Abstract: AbstractAutoregressive language models (LMs) map token sequences to probabilities. The usual practice for computing the probability of any character string (e.g. English sentences) is to first transform it into a sequence of tokens that is scored by the model. However, there are exponentially many token sequences that represent any given string. To truly compute the probability of a string one should marginalize over all tokenizations, which is typically intractable. Here, we analyze whether the practice of ignoring the marginalization is justified. To this end, we devise an importance-sampling-based algorithm that allows us to compute estimates of the marginal probabilities and compare them to the default procedure in a range of state-of-the-art models and datasets. Our results show that the gap in log-likelihood is no larger than 0.5% in most cases, but that it becomes more pronounced for data with long complex words.

Abstract: AbstractWe introduce a new proxy score for evaluating bitext mining based on similarity in a multilingual embedding space: xsim++. In comparison to xsim, this improved proxy leverages rule-based approaches to extend English sentences in any evaluation set with synthetic, hard-to-distinguish examples which more closely mirror the scenarios we encounter during large-scale mining. We validate this proxy by running a significant number of bitext mining experiments for a set of low-resource languages, and subsequently train NMT systems on the mined data. In comparison to xsim, we show that xsim++ is better correlated with the downstream BLEU scores of translation systems trained on mined bitexts, providing a reliable proxy of bitext mining performance without needing to run expensive bitext mining pipelines. xsim++ also reports performance for different error types, offering more fine-grained feedbacks for model development.

Abstract: AbstractPrior study has shown that pretrained language models (PLM) can boost the performance of text-based recommendation. In contrast to previous works that either use PLM to encode user history as a whole input text, or impose an additional aggregation network to fuse multi-turn history representations, we propose a unified local- and global-attention Transformer encoder to better model two-level contexts of user history. Moreover, conditioned on user history encoded by Transformer encoders, our framework leverages Transformer decoders to estimate the language perplexity of candidate text items, which can serve as a straightforward yet significant contrastive signal for user-item text matching. Based on this, our framework, UniTRec, unifies the contrastive objectives of discriminative matching scores and candidate text perplexity to jointly enhance text-based recommendation. Extensive evaluation shows that UniTRec delivers SOTA performance on three text-based recommendation tasks.

Abstract: AbstractWhile sentiment analysis systems try to determine the sentiment polarities of given targets based on the key opinion expressions in input texts, in implicit sentiment analysis (ISA) the opinion cues come in an implicit and obscure manner. Thus detecting implicit sentiment requires the common-sense and multi-hop reasoning ability to infer the latent intent of opinion. Inspired by the recent chain-of-thought (CoT) idea, in this work we introduce a Three-hop Reasoning (THOR) CoT framework to mimic the human-like reasoning process for ISA. We design a three-step prompting principle for THOR to step-by-step induce the implicit aspect, opinion, and finally the sentiment polarity. Our THOR+Flan-T5 (11B) pushes the state-of-the-art (SoTA) by over 6% F1 on supervised setup. More strikingly, THOR+GPT3 (175B) boosts the SoTA by over 50% F1 on zero-shot setting.

Abstract: AbstractThe use of positional embeddings in transformer language models is widely accepted. However, recent research has called into question the necessity of such embeddings. We further extend this inquiry by demonstrating that a randomly initialized and frozen transformer language model, devoid of positional embeddings, inherently encodes strong positional information through the shrinkage of self-attention variance. To quantify this variance, we derive the underlying distribution of each step within a transformer layer. Through empirical validation using a fully pretrained model, we show that the variance shrinkage effect still persists after extensive gradient updates. Our findings serve to justify the decision to discard positional embeddings and thus facilitate more efficient pretraining of transformer language models.

Abstract: AbstractIn the last few years, several studies have been devoted to dissecting dense text representations in order to understand their effectiveness and further improve their quality. Particularly, the anisotropy of such representations has been observed, which means that the directions of the word vectors are not evenly distributed across the space but rather concentrated in a narrow cone. This has led to several attempts to counteract this phenomenon both on static and contextualized text representations. However, despite this effort, there is no established relationship between anisotropy and performance. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the impact of different transformations on both the isotropy and the performance in order to assess the true impact of anisotropy. To this end, we rely on the clustering task as a means of evaluating the ability of text representations to produce meaningful groups. Thereby, we empirically show a limited impact of anisotropy on the expressiveness of sentence representations both in terms of directions and L2 closeness.

Abstract: AbstractInfluence functions (IFs) are a powerful tool for detecting anomalous examples in large scale datasets. However, they are unstable when applied to deep networks. In this paper, we provide an explanation for the instability of IFs and develop a solution to this problem. We show that IFs are unreliable when the two data points belong to two different classes. Our solution leverages class information to improve the stability of IFs.Extensive experiments show that our modification significantly improves the performance and stability of IFs while incurring no additional computational cost.

Abstract: AbstractText revision is a necessary process to improve text quality. During this process, writers constantly edit texts out of different edit intentions. Identifying edit intention for a raw text is always an ambiguous work, and most previous work on revision systems mainly focuses on editing texts according to one specific edit intention. In this work, we aim to build a multi-intent text revision system that could revise texts without explicit intent annotation. Our system is based on prefix-tuning, which first gets prefixes for every edit intent, and then trains a prefix transfer module, enabling the system to selectively leverage the knowledge from various prefixes according to the input text. We conduct experiments on the IteraTeR dataset, and the results show that our system outperforms baselines. The system can significantly improve the SARI score with more than 3% improvements, which thrives on the learned editing intention prefixes.

Abstract: AbstractMathematical reasoning is regarded as a necessary ability for Language Models (LMs). Recent works demonstrate large LMs’ impressive performance in solving math problems. The success is attributed to their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning abilities, i.e., the ability to decompose complex questions into step-by-step reasoning chains, but such ability seems only to emerge from models with abundant parameters. This work investigates how to incorporate relatively small LMs with the capabilities of multi-step reasoning. We propose to inject such abilities by continually pre-training LMs on a synthetic dataset MsAT which is composed of Multi-step Arithmetic Tasks. Our experiments on four math word problem datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing LMs’ math reasoning abilities.

Abstract: AbstractFine-tuning large pre-trained language models on various downstream tasks with whole parameters is prohibitively expensive. Hence, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has attracted attention that only optimizes a few task-specific parameters with the frozen pre-trained model. In this work, we focus on prefix tuning, which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers. Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism. Experiments on the SuperGLUE and NER datasets show the effectiveness of APT. In addition, taking the gate as a probing, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the variable prefix.

Abstract: AbstractExisting studies addressing gender bias of pre-trained language models, usually build a small gender-neutral data set and conduct a second phase pre-training on the model with such data. However, given the limited size and concentrated focus of the gender-neutral data, catastrophic forgetting would occur during second-phase pre-training. Forgetting information in the original training data may damage the model’s downstream performance by a large margin. In this work, we empirically show that catastrophic forgetting occurs in such methods by evaluating them with general NLP tasks in GLUE. Then, we propose a new method, GEnder Equality Prompt (GEEP), to improve gender fairness of pre-trained models with less forgetting. GEEP freezes the pre-trained model and learns gender-related prompts with gender-neutral data. Empirical results show that GEEP not only achieves SOTA performances on gender fairness tasks, but also forgets less and performs better on GLUE by a large margin.

Abstract: AbstractDespite the great success of pre-trained language models, it is still a challenge to use these models for continual learning, especially for the class-incremental learning (CIL) setting due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). This paper reports our finding that if we formulate CIL as a continual label generation problem, CF is drastically reduced and the generalizable representations of pre-trained models can be better retained. We thus propose a new CIL method (VAG) that also leverages the sparsity of vocabulary to focus the generation and creates pseudo-replay samples by using label semantics. Experimental results show that VAG outperforms baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: AbstractData augmentation is an effective solution to improve model performance and robustness for low-resource named entity recognition (NER). However, synthetic data often suffer from poor diversity, which leads to performance limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Propagated Data Augmentation (GPDA) framework for Named Entity Recognition (NER), leveraging graph propagation to build relationships between labeled data and unlabeled natural texts. By projecting the annotations from the labeled text to the unlabeled text, the unlabeled texts are partially labeled, which has more diversity rather than synthetic annotated data. To strengthen the propagation precision, a simple search engine built on Wikipedia is utilized to fetch related texts of labeled data and to propagate the entity labels to them in the light of the anchor links. Besides, we construct and perform experiments on a real-world low-resource dataset of the E-commerce domain, which will be publicly available to facilitate the low-resource NER research. Experimental results show that GPDA presents substantial improvements over previous data augmentation methods on multiple low-resource NER datasets.

Abstract: AbstractEvaluating grounded neural language model performance with respect to pragmatic qualities like the trade off between truthfulness, contrastivity and overinformativity of generated utterances remains a challenge in absence of data collected from humans. To enable such evaluation, we present a novel open source image-text dataset “Annotated 3D Shapes” (A3DS) comprising over nine million exhaustive natural language annotations and over 12 million variable-granularity captions for the 480,000 images provided by Burgess & Kim (2018).We showcase the evaluation of pragmatic abilities developed by a task-neutral image captioner fine-tuned in a multi-agent communication setting to produce contrastive captions. The evaluation is enabled by the dataset because the exhaustive annotations allow to quantify the presence of contrastive features in the model’s generations. We show that the model develops human-like patterns (informativity, brevity, over-informativity for specific features (e.g., shape, color biases)).

Abstract: AbstractWe compare various forms of prompts to represent event types and develop a unified framework to incorporate the event type specific prompts for supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot event detection. The experimental results demonstrate that a well-defined and comprehensive event type prompt can significantly improve event detection performance, especially when the annotated data is scarce (few-shot event detection) or not available (zero-shot event detection). By leveraging the semantics of event types, our unified framework shows up to 22.2% F-score gain over the previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: AbstractThis paper studies the impact of layer normalization (LayerNorm) on zero-shot translation (ZST). Recent efforts for ZST often utilize the Transformer architecture as the backbone, with LayerNorm at the input of layers (PreNorm) set as the default. However, Xu et al. (2019) has revealed that PreNorm carries the risk of overfitting the training data. Based on this, we hypothesize that PreNorm may overfit supervised directions and thus have low generalizability for ZST. Through experiments on OPUS, IWSLT, and Europarl datasets for 54 ZST directions, we demonstrate that the original Transformer setting of LayerNorm after residual connections (PostNorm) consistently outperforms PreNorm by up to 12.3 BLEU points. We then study the performance disparities by analyzing the differences in off-target rates and structural variations between PreNorm and PostNorm. This study highlights the need for careful consideration of the LayerNorm setting for ZST.

Abstract: AbstractRecent works on instruction tuning (IT) have achieved great performance with zero-shot generalizability to unseen tasks. With additional context (e.g., task definition, examples) provided to models for fine-tuning, they achieved much higher performance than untuned models. Despite impressive performance gains, what models learn from IT remains understudied. In this work, we analyze how models utilize instructions during IT by comparing model training with altered vs. original instructions. Specifically, we create simplified task definitions by removing all semantic components and only leaving the output space information, and delusive examples that contain incorrect input-output mapping. Our experiments show that models trained on simplified task definition or delusive examples can achieve comparable performance to the ones trained on the original instructions and examples. Furthermore, we introduce a random baseline to perform zeroshot classification tasks, and find it achieves similar performance (42.6% exact-match) as IT does (43% exact-match) in low resource setting, while both methods outperform naive T5 significantly (30% per exact-match). Our analysis provides evidence that the impressive performance gain of current IT models can come from picking up superficial patterns, such as learning the output format and guessing. Our study highlights the urgent need for more reliable IT methods and evaluation.

Abstract: AbstractWe investigate the effects of post-training quantization and quantization-aware training on the generalization of Transformer language models. We present a new method called self-distilled quantization (SDQ) that minimizes accumulative quantization errors and outperforms baselines. We apply SDQ to multilingual models XLM-RBase and InfoXLMBase and demonstrate that both models can be reduced from 32-bit floating point weights to 8-bit integer weights while maintaining a high level of performance on the XGLUE benchmark. Our results also highlight the challenges of quantizing multilingual models, which must generalize to languages they were not fine-tuned on.

Abstract: AbstractPre-training and fine-tuning is a paradigm for alleviating the data scarcity problem in end-to-end speech translation (E2E ST). The commonplace ”modality gap” between speech and text data often leads to inconsistent inputs between pre-training and fine-tuning. However, we observe that this gap occurs in the early stages of fine-tuning, but does not have a major impact on the final performance. On the other hand, we find that there has another gap, which we call the ”capacity gap”: high resource tasks (such as ASR and MT) always require a large model to fit, when the model is reused for a low resource task (E2E ST), it will get a sub-optimal performance due to the over-fitting. In a case study, we find that the regularization plays a more important role than the well-designed modality adaption method, which achieves 29.0 for en-de and 40.3 for en-fr on the MuST-C dataset.

Abstract: AbstractJointly extracting entity pairs and their relations is challenging when working on distantly-supervised data with ambiguous or noisy labels. To mitigate such impact, we propose uncertainty-aware bootstrap learning, which is motivated by the intuition that the higher uncertainty of an instance, the more likely the model confidence is inconsistent with the ground truths. Specifically, we first explore instance-level data uncertainty to create an initial high-confident examples. Such subset serves as filtering noisy instances and facilitating the model to converge fast at the early stage. During bootstrap learning, we propose self-ensembling as a regularizer to alleviate inter-model uncertainty produced by noisy labels. We further define probability variance of joint tagging probabilities to estimate inner-model parametric uncertainty, which is used to select and build up new reliable training instances for the next iteration. Experimental results on two large datasets reveal that our approach outperforms existing strong baselines and related methods.

Abstract: AbstractDespite recent progress in text-to-SQL parsing, current semantic parsers are still not accurate enough for practical use. In this paper, we investigate how to build automatic text-to-SQL error correction models. Noticing that token-level edits are out of context and sometimes ambiguous, we propose building clause-level edit models instead. Besides, while most language models of code are not specifically pre-trained for SQL, they know common data structures and their operations in programming languages such as Python. Thus, we propose a novel representation for SQL queries and their edits that adheres more closely to the pre-training corpora of language models of code. Our error correction model improves the exact set match accuracy of different parsers by 2.4-6.5 and obtains up to 4.3 point absolute improvement over two strong baselines.

Abstract: AbstractHow reliably can we trust the scores obtained from social bias benchmarks as faithful indicators of problematic social biases in a given model? In this work, we study this question by contrasting social biases with non-social biases that stem from choices made during dataset construction (which might not even be discernible to the human eye). To do so, we empirically simulate various alternative constructions for a given benchmark based on seemingly innocuous modifications (such as paraphrasing or random-sampling) that maintain the essence of their social bias. On two well-known social bias benchmarks (Winogender and BiasNLI), we observe that these shallow modifications have a surprising effect on the resulting degree of bias across various models and consequently the relative ordering of these models when ranked by measured bias. We hope these troubling observations motivate more robust measures of social biases.

Abstract: AbstractLarge language models, particularly GPT-3, are able to produce high quality summaries ofgeneral domain news articles in few- and zero-shot settings. However, it is unclear if such models are similarly capable in more specialized domains such as biomedicine. In this paper we enlist domain experts (individuals with medical training) to evaluate summaries of biomedical articles generated by GPT-3, given no supervision. We consider bothsingle- and multi-document settings. In the former, GPT-3 is tasked with generating regular and plain-language summaries of articles describing randomized controlled trials; in thelatter, we assess the degree to which GPT-3 is able to synthesize evidence reported acrossa collection of articles. We design an annotation scheme for evaluating model outputs, withan emphasis on assessing the factual accuracy of generated summaries. We find that whileGPT-3 is able to summarize and simplify single biomedical articles faithfully, it strugglesto provide accurate aggregations of findings over multiple documents. We release all data,code, and annotations used in this work.

Abstract: AbstractDataset distillation aims to create a small dataset of informative synthetic samples to rapidly train neural networks that retain the performance of the original dataset. In this paper, we focus on constructing distilled few-shot datasets for natural language processing (NLP) tasks to fine-tune pre-trained transformers. Specifically, we propose to introduce attention labels, which can efficiently distill the knowledge from the original dataset and transfer it to the transformer models via attention probabilities. We evaluated our dataset distillation methods in four various NLP tasks and demonstrated that it is possible to create distilled few-shot datasets with the attention labels, yielding impressive performances for fine-tuning BERT. Specifically, in AGNews, a four-class news classification task, our distilled few-shot dataset achieved up to 93.2% accuracy, which is 98.5% performance of the original dataset even with only one sample per class and only one gradient step.

Abstract: AbstractParameter-efficient tuning aims to mitigate the large memory requirements of adapting pretrained language models for downstream tasks. For example, one popular method, prefix-tuning, prepends trainable tokens to sequences while freezing the rest of the model’s parameters. Although such models attain comparable performance with fine-tuning when applied to sequences with short to moderate lengths, we show their inferior performance when modelling long sequences. To bridge this gap, we propose prefix-propagation, a simple but effective approach that conditions prefixes on previous hidden states. We empirically demonstrate that prefix-propagation outperforms prefix-tuning across long-document tasks, while using 50% fewer parameters. To further investigate the proposed architecture, we also show its advantage in calibration, and perform additional study on its relationship with kernel attention. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to focus on parameter-efficient learning for long-sequence language tasks.

Abstract: AbstractPhotoBook is a collaborative dialogue game where two players receive private, partially-overlapping sets of images and resolve which images they have in common. It presents machines with a great challenge to learn how people build common ground around multimodal context to communicate effectively. Methods developed in the literature, however, cannot be deployed to real gameplaysince they only tackle some subtasks of the game,and they require additional reference chains inputs, whose extraction process is imperfect. Therefore, we propose a reference chain-free listener modelthat directly addresses the game’s predictive task, i.e., deciding whether an image is shared with partner. Our DeBERTa-based listener model reads the full dialogue, and utilizesCLIPScore features to assess utterance-image relevance. We achieve >77% accuracy on unseen sets of images/game themes, outperforming baseline by >17 points.

Abstract: AbstractAutomatic postediting (APE) is an automated process to refine a given machine translation (MT). Recent findings present that existing APE systems are not good at handling high-quality MTs even for a language pair with abundant data resources, English–German: the better the given MT is, the harder it is to decide what parts to edit and how to fix these errors. One possible solution to this problem is to instill deeper knowledge about the target language into the model. Thus, we propose a linguistically motivated method of regularization that is expected to enhance APE models’ understanding of the target language: a loss function that encourages symmetric self-attention on the given MT. Our analysis of experimental results demonstrates that the proposed method helps improving the state-of-the-art architecture’s APE quality for high-quality MTs.

Abstract: AbstractNamed entity recognition (NER) is the task to detect and classify entity spans in the text. When entity spans overlap between each other, the task is named as nested NER. Span-based methods have been widely used to tackle nested NER. Most of these methods get a score matrix, where each entry corresponds to a span. However, previous work ignores spatial relations in the score matrix. In this paper, we propose using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model these spatial relations. Despite being simple, experiments in three commonly used nested NER datasets show that our model surpasses several recently proposed methods with the same pre-trained encoders. Further analysis shows that using CNN can help the model find more nested entities. Besides, we find that different papers use different sentence tokenizations for the three nested NER datasets, which will influence the comparison. Thus, we release a pre-processing script to facilitate future comparison.

Abstract: AbstractWe introduce a novel dependency parser, the hexatagger, that constructs dependency trees by tagging the words in a sentence with elements from a finite set of possible tags. In contrast to many approaches to dependency parsing, our approach is fully parallelizable at training time, i.e., the structure-building actions needed to build a dependency parse can be predicted in parallel to each other. Additionally, exact decoding is linear in time and space complexity. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic dependency parser that predicts hexatags using no more than a linear model with features from a pretrained language model, i.e., we forsake a bespoke architecture explicitly designed for the task. Despite the generality and simplicity of our approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance of 96.4 LAS and 97.4 UAS on the Penn Treebank test set. Additionally, our parser’s linear time complexity and parallelism significantly improve computational efficiency, with a roughly 10-times speed-up over previous state-of-the-art models during decoding.

Abstract: AbstractDemonstration-based learning has shown impressive performance in exploiting pretrained language models under few-shot learning settings. It is interesting to see that demonstrations, even those composed of random tokens, can still improve performance. In this paper, we build a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to understand demonstration-based learning from causal perspectives and interpret random demonstrations as interventions on the demonstration variable within the causal model. We investigate the causal effects and find that the concurrence of specific words in the demonstration will induce bias, while randomly sampled tokens in the demonstration do not. Based on this finding, we further propose simple ways to construct random demonstrations, which even outperform hand-crafted, meaningful demonstrations on public sequence labeling benchmarks.

Abstract: AbstractAttribute-controlled translation (ACT) is a subtask of machine translation that involves controlling stylistic or linguistic attributes (like formality and gender) of translation outputs. While ACT has garnered attention in recent years due to its usefulness in real-world applications, progress in the task is currently limited by dataset availability, since most prior approaches rely on supervised methods. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval and Attribute-Marking enhanced Prompting (RAMP), which leverages large multilingual language models to perform ACT in few-shot and zero-shot settings. RAMP improves generation accuracy over the standard prompting approach by (1) incorporating a semantic similarity retrieval component for selecting similar in-context examples, and (2) marking in-context examples with attribute annotations. Our comprehensive experiments show that RAMP is a viable approach in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Abstract: AbstractZero-shot and few-shot stance detection identify the polarity of text with regard to a certain target when we have only limited or no training resources for the target. Previous work generally formulates the problem into a classification setting, ignoring the potential use of label text. In this paper, we instead utilize a conditional generation framework and formulate the problem as denoising from partially-filled templates, which can better utilize the semantics among input, label, and target texts. We further propose to jointly train an auxiliary task, target prediction, and to incorporate manually constructed incorrect samples with unlikelihood training to improve the representations for both target and label texts. We also verify the effectiveness of target-related Wikipedia knowledge with the generation framework. Experiments show that our proposed method significantly outperforms several strong baselines on VAST, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: AbstractAnxiety disorders are the most common of mental illnesses, but relatively little is known about how to detect them from language. The primary clinical manifestation of anxiety is worry associated cognitive distortions, which are likely expressed at the discourse-level of semantics. Here, we investigate the development of a modern linguistic assessment for degree of anxiety, specifically evaluating the utility of discourse-level information in addition to lexical-level large language model embeddings. We find that a combined lexico-discourse model outperforms models based solely on state-of-the-art contextual embeddings (RoBERTa), with discourse-level representations derived from Sentence-BERT and DiscRE both providing additional predictive power not captured by lexical-level representations. Interpreting the model, we find that discourse patterns of causal explanations, among others, were used significantly more by those scoring high in anxiety, dovetailing with psychological literature.

Abstract: AbstractLarge Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize significant portions of their training data. Parts of this memorized content have been shown to be extractable by simply querying the model, which poses a privacy risk. We present a novel approach which uses prompt-tuning to control the extraction rates of memorized content in LLMs. We present two prompt training strategies to increase and decrease extraction rates, which correspond to an attack and a defense, respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by using models from the GPT-Neo family on a public benchmark. For the 1.3B parameter GPT-Neo model, our attack yields a 9.3 percentage point increase in extraction rate compared to our baseline. Our defense can be tuned to achieve different privacy-utility trade-offs by a user-specified hyperparameter. We achieve an extraction rate reduction of up to 97.7% relative to our baseline, with a perplexity increase of 16.9%.

Abstract: AbstractIn Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), the input can be modeled as a set of documents, and the output is its summary. In this paper, we focus on pretraining objectives for MDS. Specifically, we introduce a novel pretraining objective, which involves selecting the ROUGE-based centroid of each document cluster as a proxy for its summary. Our objective thus does not require human written summaries and can be utilized for pretraining on a dataset consisting solely of document sets. Through zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised experiments on multiple MDS datasets, we show that our model Centrum is better or comparable to a state-of-the-art model. We make the pretrained and fine-tuned models freely available to the research community https://github.com/ratishsp/centrum.

Abstract: AbstractWe present multilingual Pre-trained Machine Reader (mPMR), a novel method for multilingual machine reading comprehension (MRC)-style pre-training. mPMR aims to guide multilingual pre-trained language models (mPLMs) to perform natural language understanding (NLU) including both sequence classification and span extraction in multiple languages. To achieve cross-lingual generalization when only source-language fine-tuning data is available, existing mPLMs solely transfer NLU capability from a source language to target languages. In contrast, mPMR allows the direct inheritance of multilingual NLU capability from the MRC-style pre-training to downstream tasks. Therefore, mPMR acquires better NLU capability for target languages. mPMR also provides a unified solver for tackling cross-lingual span extraction and sequence classification, thereby enabling the extraction of rationales to explain the sentence-pair classification process.

Abstract: AbstractAs a subjective metric to evaluate the quality of synthesized speech, Mean opinion score(MOS) usually requires multiple annotators to score the same speech. Such an annotation approach requires a lot of manpower and is also time-consuming. MOS prediction model for automatic evaluation can significantly reduce labor cost. In previous works, it is difficult to accurately rank the quality of speech when the MOS scores are close. However, in practical applications, it is more important to correctly rank the quality of synthesis systems or sentences than simply predicting MOS scores. Meanwhile, as each annotator scores multiple audios during annotation, the score is probably a relative value based on the first or the first few speech scores given by the annotator. Motivated by the above two points, we propose a general framework for MOS prediction based on pair comparison (MOSPC), and we utilize C-Mixup algorithm to enhance the generalization performance of MOSPC.The experiments on BVCC and VCC2018 show that our framework outperforms the baselines on most of the correlation coefficient metrics, especially on the metric KTAU related to quality ranking. And our framework also surpasses the strong baseline in ranking accuracy on each fine-grained segment. These results indicate that our framework contributes to improving the ranking accuracy of speech quality.

Abstract: AbstractRecent open-domain TableQA models are typically implemented as retriever-reader pipelines. The retriever component is usually a variant of the Dense Passage Retriever, which computes the similarities between questions and tables based on a single representation of each. These fixed vectors can be insufficient to capture fine-grained features of potentially very big tables with heterogeneous row/column information. We address this limitation by 1) applying late interaction models which enforce a finer-grained interaction between question and table embeddings at retrieval time. In addition, we 2) incorporate a joint training scheme of the retriever and reader with explicit table-level signals, and 3) embed a binary relevance token as a prefix to the answer generated by the reader, so we can determine at inference time whether the table used to answer the question is reliable and filter accordingly. The combined strategies set a new state-to-the-art performance on two public open-domain TableQA datasets.

Abstract: AbstractIncomplete utterance rewriting (IUR) aims to restore the incomplete utterance with sufficient context information for comprehension. This paper introduces a simple yet efficient IUR method. Different from prior studies, we first employ only one-layer MLP architecture to mine latent semantic information between joint utterances for IUR task (MIUR). After that, we conduct a joint feature matrix to predict the token type and thus restore the incomplete utterance. The well-designed network and simple architecture make our method significantly superior to existing methods in terms of quality and inference speedOur code is available at https://github.com/IMU-MachineLearningSXD/MIUR.

Abstract: AbstractThe recent introduction of large-scale datasets for the WiC (Word in Context) task enables the creation of more reliable and meaningful contextualized word embeddings.However, most of the approaches to the WiC task use cross-encoders, which prevent the possibility of deriving comparable word embeddings.In this work, we introduce XL-LEXEME, a Lexical Semantic Change Detection model.XL-LEXEME extends SBERT, highlighting the target word in the sentence. We evaluate XL-LEXEME on the multilingual benchmarks for SemEval-2020 Task 1 - Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) Detection and the RuShiftEval shared task involving five languages: English, German, Swedish, Latin, and Russian.XL-LEXEME outperforms the state-of-the-art in English, German and Swedish with statistically significant differences from the baseline results and obtains state-of-the-art performance in the RuShiftEval shared task.

Abstract: AbstractIn this position paper, we argue that computational text analysis lacks and requires organizing principles. A broad space separates its two constituent disciplines—natural language processing and social science—which has to date been sidestepped rather than filled by applying increasingly complex computational models to problems in social science research. We contrast descriptive and integrative findings, and our review of approximately 60 papers on computational text analysis reveals that those from *ACL venues are typically descriptive. The lack of theory began at the area’s inception and has over the decades, grown more important and challenging. A return to theoretically grounded research questions will propel the area from both theoretical and methodological points of view.

Abstract: AbstractIn this paper, we examine the current state-of-the-art in AMR parsing, which relies on ensemble strategies by merging multiple graph predictions. Our analysis reveals that the present models often violate AMR structural constraints. To address this issue, we develop a validation method, and show how ensemble models can exploit SMATCH metric weaknesses to obtain higher scores, but sometimes result in corrupted graphs. Additionally, we highlight the demanding need to compute the SMATCH score among all possible predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel ensemble strategies based on Transformer models, improving robustness to structural constraints, while also reducing the computational time. Our methods provide new insights for enhancing AMR parsers and metrics. Our code is available at [https://www.github.com/babelscape/AMRs-Assemble](https://www.github.com/babelscape/AMRs-Assemble).

Abstract: AbstractGenerative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) has demonstrates its great success in natural language processing and related techniques have been adapted into molecular modeling. Considering that text is the most important record for scientific discovery, in this paper, we propose MolXPT, a unified language model of text and molecules pre-trained on SMILES (a sequence representation of molecules) wrapped by text. Briefly, we detect the molecule names in each sequence and replace them to the corresponding SMILES. In this way, the SMILES could leverage the information from surrounding text, and vice versa. The above wrapped sequences, text sequences from PubMed and SMILES sequences from PubChem are all fed into a language model for pre-training. Experimental results demonstrate that MolXPT outperforms strong baselines of molecular property prediction on MoleculeNet, performs comparably to the best model in text-molecule translation while using less than half of its parameters, and enables zero-shot molecular generation without finetuning.

Abstract: AbstractHybrid retrievers can take advantage of both sparse and dense retrievers. Previous hybrid retrievers leverage indexing-heavy dense retrievers. In this work, we study “Is it possible to reduce the indexing memory of hybrid retrievers without sacrificing performance”? Driven by this question, we leverage an indexing-efficient dense retriever (i.e. DrBoost) and introduce a LITE retriever that further reduces the memory of DrBoost. LITE is jointly trained on contrastive learning and knowledge distillation from DrBoost. Then, we integrate BM25, a sparse retriever, with either LITE or DrBoost to form light hybrid retrievers. Our Hybrid-LITE retriever saves 13× memory while maintaining 98.0% performance of the hybrid retriever of BM25 and DPR. In addition, we study the generalization capacity of our light hybrid retrievers on out-of-domain dataset and a set of adversarial attacks datasets. Experiments showcase that light hybrid retrievers achieve better generalization performance than individual sparse and dense retrievers. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that there is a large room to improve the robustness of retrievers, suggesting a new research direction.

Abstract: AbstractNeural language models are increasingly valued in computational psycholinguistics, due to their ability to provide conditional probability distributions over the lexicon that are predictive of human processing times. Given the vast array of available models, it is of both theoretical and methodological importance to assess what features of a model influence its psychometric quality. In this work we focus on parameter size, showing that larger Transformer-based language models generate probabilistic estimates that are less predictive of early eye-tracking measurements reflecting lexical access and early semantic integration. However, relatively bigger models show an advantage in capturing late eye-tracking measurements that reflect the full semantic and syntactic integration of a word into the current language context. Our results are supported by eye movement data in ten languages and consider four models, spanning from 564M to 4.5B parameters.

Abstract: AbstractWe consider the automated generation of sonnets, a poetic form constrained according to meter, rhyme scheme, and length. Sonnets generally also use rhetorical figures, expressive language, and a consistent theme or narrative. Our constrained decoding approach allows for the generation of sonnets within preset poetic constraints, while using a relatively modest neural backbone. Human evaluation confirms that our approach produces Shakespearean sonnets that resemble human-authored sonnets, and which adhere to the genre’s defined constraints and contain lyrical language and literary devices.

Abstract: AbstractWe present the first unified study of the efficiency of self-attention-based Transformer variants spanning text, speech and vision. We identify input length thresholds (tipping points) at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory). To conduct this analysis for speech, we introduce L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model. We observe that these thresholds are (a) much higher than typical dataset sequence lengths and (b) dependent on the metric and modality, showing that choosing the right model depends on modality, task type (long-form vs. typical context) and resource constraints (time vs. memory). By visualising the breakdown of the computational costs for transformer components, we also show that non-self-attention components exhibit significant computational costs. We release our profiling toolkit at https://github.com/ajd12342/profiling-transformers .

Abstract: AbstractZero-shot event extraction (EE) methods infer richly structured event records from text, based only on a minimal user specification and no training examples, which enables flexibility in exploring and developing applications. Most event extraction research uses the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) annotated dataset to evaluate supervised EE methods, but can it be used to evaluate zero-shot and other low-supervision EE? We describe ACE’s event structures and identify significant ambiguities and issues in current evaluation practice, including (1) coreferent argument mentions, (2) conflicting argument head conventions, and (3) ignorance of modality and event class details. By sometimes mishandling these subtleties, current work may dramatically understate the actual performance of zero-shot and other low-supervision EE, considering up to 32% of correctly identified arguments and 25% of correctly ignored event mentions as false negatives. For each issue, we propose recommendations for future evaluations so the research community can better utilize ACE as an event evaluation resource.

Abstract: AbstractRecent work on Event Extraction has reframed the task as Question Answering (QA), with promising results. The advantage of this approach is that it addresses the error propagation issue found in traditional token-based classification approaches by directly predicting event arguments without extracting candidates first. However, the questions are typically based on fixed templates and they rarely leverage contextual information such as relevant arguments. In addition, prior QA-based approaches have difficulty handling cases where there are multiple arguments for the same role. In this paper, we propose QGA-EE, which enables a Question Generation (QG) model to generate questions that incorporate rich contextual information instead of using fixed templates. We also propose dynamic templates to assist the training of QG model. Experiments show that QGA-EE outperforms all prior single-task-based models on the ACE05 English dataset.

Abstract: AbstractRecent results in image classification and extractive question answering have observed that pre-trained models trained on less in-distribution data have better out-ofdistribution performance. However, it is unclear how broadly these trends hold. We conduct a large empirical study across three tasks, three broadly-applicable modeling interventions (increasing model size, using a different adaptation method, and pre-training on more data), and 14 diverse datasets to investigate the relationship between sample efficiency (amount of data needed to reach a given ID accuracy) and robustness (how models fare on OOD evaluation). We find that higher sample efficiency is only correlated with better average OOD robustness on some modeling interventions and tasks, but not others. On individual datasets, models with lower sample efficiency can even be more robust. These results suggest that general-purpose methods for improving sample efficiency are unlikely to yield universal OOD robustness improvements, since such improvements are highly dataset- and task-dependent. Even in an era of large, multi-purpose pre-trained models, task-specific decisions may often be necessary for OOD generalization.

Abstract: AbstractThe standard approach for neural topic modeling uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework that jointly minimizes the KL divergence between the estimated posterior and prior, in addition to the reconstruction loss. Since neural topic models are trained by recreating individual input documents, they do not explicitly capture the coherence between words on the corpus level. In this work, we propose a novel diversity-aware coherence loss that encourages the model to learn corpus-level coherence scores while maintaining high diversity between topics. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that our method significantly improves the performance of neural topic models without requiring any pretraining or additional parameters.

Abstract: AbstractLarge-scale language model pretraining is a very successful form of self-supervised learning in natural language processing, but it is increasingly expensive to perform as the models and pretraining corpora have become larger over time. We propose NarrowBERT, a modified transformer encoder that increases the throughput for masked language model pretraining by more than 2x. NarrowBERT sparsifies the transformer model such that the self-attention queries and feedforward layers only operate on the masked tokens of each sentence during pretraining, rather than all of the tokens as with the usual transformer encoder. We also show that NarrowBERT increases the throughput at inference time by as much as 3.5x with minimal (or no) performance degradation on sentence encoding tasks like MNLI. Finally, we examine the performance of NarrowBERT on the IMDB and Amazon reviews classification and CoNLL NER tasks and show that it is also comparable to standard BERT performance.

Abstract: AbstractAnswering multi-hop questions over hybrid factual knowledge from the given text and table (TextTableQA) is a challenging task. Existing models mainly adopt a retriever-reader framework, which have several deficiencies, such as noisy labeling in training retriever, insufficient utilization of heterogeneous information over text and table, and deficient ability for different reasoning operations. In this paper, we propose a three-stage TextTableQA framework S3HQA, which comprises of retriever, selector, and reasoner. We use a retriever with refinement training to solve the noisy labeling problem. Then, a hybrid selector considers the linked relationships between heterogeneous data to select the most relevant factual knowledge. For the final stage, instead of adapting a reading comprehension module like in previous methods, we employ a generation-based reasoner to obtain answers. This includes two approaches: a row-wise generator and an LLM prompting generator (first time used in this task). The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive results in the few-shot setting. When trained on the full dataset, our approach outperforms all baseline methods, ranking first on the HybridQA leaderboard.

Abstract: AbstractExisting knowledge-grounded open-domain dialogue generation models often face the hallucination problem, i.e. the dialogue generative model will persist in an inappropriate knowledge and generate responses that inconsistent with the facts. We argue that this problem mainly stems from the polarized optimization objectives and weak knowledge generation ability. To mitigate the hallucination, we take inspiration from human communicating that people will replay euphemistic responses for the unclear or unrecognizable knowledge, and propose an Augmentative and Contrastive Knowledge Dialogue Expansion Framework (ACK-DEF). ACK-DEF constructs the augmentative and contrastive knowledge dialogue samples, which consist of the knowledge of different degrees of errors and the response of manual design, to expand the original training set and smooth the polarized optimization objective that enables models to generate ground-truth with or without gold knowledge. Not only the knowledge, ACK-DEF also provides the tactful responses of manual design corresponding to the incomplete correct knowledge. Experimental results on the Wikipedia of Wizard dataset show that employing the ACK-DEF is effective to alleviate the hallucination problem.

Abstract: AbstractInformation-seeking conversation, which aims to help users gather information through conversation, has achieved great progress in recent years. However, the research is still stymied by the scarcity of training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose AutoConv for synthetic conversation generation, which takes advantage of the few-shot learning ability and generation capacity of large language models (LLM). Specifically, we formulate the conversation generation problem as a language modeling task, then finetune an LLM with a few human conversations to capture the characteristics of the information-seeking process and use it for generating synthetic conversations with high quality. Experimental results on two frequently-used datasets verify that AutoConv has substantial improvements over strong baselines and alleviates the dependence on human annotation. In addition, we also provide several analysis studies to promote future research.

Abstract: AbstractCompositional and domain generalization present significant challenges in semantic parsing, even for state-of-the-art semantic parsers based on pre-trained language models (LMs). In this study, we empirically investigate improving an LM’s generalization in semantic parsing with two simple techniques: at the token level, we introduce a token preprocessing method to preserve the semantic boundaries of tokens produced by LM tokenizers; at the sequence level, we propose to use special tokens to mark the boundaries of components aligned between input and output. Our experimental results on two text-to-SQL semantic parsing datasets show that our token preprocessing, although simple, can substantially improve the LM performance on both types of generalization, and our component boundary marking method is particularly helpful for compositional generalization.

Abstract: AbstractWe present STT4SG-350, a corpus of Swiss German speech, annotated with Standard German text at the sentence level. The data is collected using a web app in which the speakers are shown Standard German sentences, which they translate to Swiss German and record. We make the corpus publicly available. It contains 343 hours of speech from all dialect regions and is the largest public speech corpus for Swiss German to date. Application areas include automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech, dialect identification, and speaker recognition. Dialect information, age group, and gender of the 316 speakers are provided. Genders are equally represented and the corpus includes speakers of all ages. Roughly the same amount of speech is provided per dialect region, which makes the corpus ideally suited for experiments with speech technology for different dialects. We provide training, validation, and test splits of the data. The test set consists of the same spoken sentences for each dialect region and allows a fair evaluation of the quality of speech technologies in different dialects. We train an ASR model on the training set and achieve an average BLEU score of 74.7 on the test set. The model beats the best published BLEU scores on 2 other Swiss German ASR test sets, demonstrating the quality of the corpus.

Abstract: AbstractChain of thought prompting successfully improves the reasoning capabilities of large language models, achieving state of the art results on a range of datasets. However, these reasoning capabilities only appear to emerge in models with at least tens of billions of parameters. In this paper, we explore the transfer of such reasoning capabilities to smaller models via knowledge distillation, also investigating model and dataset size trade-off. Specifically, we finetune a student model on the chain of thought outputs generated by a larger teacher model. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves task performance across arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning datasets. For example, the accuracy of T5 XXL on GSM8K improves from 8.11% to 21.99% and 18.42% when finetuned on PaLM 540B and GPT-3 175B generated chains of thought, respectively.

Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on benchmark tasks, especially in zero or few-shot settings. However, these benchmarks often do not adequately address the challenges posed in the real-world, such as that of hierarchical classification. In order to address this challenge, we propose refactoring conventional tasks on hierarchical datasets into a more indicative long-tail prediction task. We observe LLMs are more prone to failure in these cases. To address these limitations, we propose the use of entailment-contradiction prediction in conjunction with LLMs, which allows for strong performance in a strict zero-shot setting. Importantly, our method does not require any parameter updates, a resource-intensive process and achieves strong performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: AbstractA triple speech translation data comprises speech, transcription, and translation. In the end-to-end paradigm, text machine translation (MT) usually plays the role of a teacher model for the speech translation (ST) via knowledge distillation. Parameter sharing with the teacher is often adopted to construct the ST model architecture, however, the two modalities are independently fed and trained via different losses. This situation does not match ST’s properties across two modalities and also limits the upper bound of the performance. Inspired by the works of video Transformer, we propose a simple unified cross-modal ST method, which concatenates speech and text as the input, and builds a teacher that can utilize both cross-modal information simultaneously. Experimental results show that in our unified ST framework, models can effectively utilize the auxiliary information from speech and text, and achieve compelling results on MuST-C datasets.

Abstract: AbstractA number of recent benchmarks seek to assess how well models handle natural language negation. However, these benchmarks lack the controlled example paradigms that would allow us to infer whether a model had truly learned how negation morphemes semantically scope. To fill these analytical gaps, we present the Scoped Negation NLI (ScoNe-NLI) benchmark, which contains contrast sets of six examples with up to two negations where either zero, one, or both negative morphemes affect the NLI label. We use ScoNe-NLI to assess fine-tuning and in-context learning strategies. We find that RoBERTa and DeBERTa models solve ScoNe-NLI after many shot fine-tuning. For in-context learning, we test the latest InstructGPT models and find that most prompt strategies are not successful, including those using step-by-step reasoning. To better understand this result, we extend ScoNe with ScoNe-NLG, a sentence completion test set that embeds negation reasoning in short narratives. Here, InstructGPT is successful, which reveals the model can correctly reason about negation, but struggles to do so on NLI examples outside of its core pretraining regime.

Abstract: AbstractCurrent literature demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs) are great few-shot learners, and prompting significantly increases their performance on a range of downstream tasks in a few-shot learning setting. An attempt to automate human-led prompting followed, with some progress achieved. In particular, subsequent work demonstrates that automation can outperform fine-tuning in certain K-shot learning scenarios. In this paper, we revisit techniques for automated prompting on six different downstream tasks and a larger range of K-shot learning settings. We find that automated prompting does not consistently outperform simple manual prompting. Our work suggests that, in addition to fine-tuning, manual prompting should be used as a baseline in this line of research.

Abstract: AbstractRecent advances in NLP have led to a rise in inter-disciplinary and application-oriented research. While this demonstrates the growing real-world impact of the field, research papers frequently feature experiments that do not account for the complexities of realistic data and environments. To explore the extent of this gap, we investigate the relationship between the real-world motivations described in NLP papers and the models and evaluation which comprise the proposed solution. We first survey papers from the NLP Applications track from ACL 2020 and EMNLP 2020, asking which papers have differences between their stated motivation and their experimental setting, and if so, mention them. We find that many papers fall short of considering real-world input and output conditions due to adopting simplified modeling or evaluation settings. As a case study, we then empirically show that the performance of an educational dialog understanding system deteriorates when used in a realistic classroom environment.

Abstract: AbstractRecently, various intermediate layer distillation (ILD) objectives have been shown to improve compression of BERT models via Knowledge Distillation (KD). However, a comprehensive evaluation of the objectives in both task-specific and task-agnostic settings is lacking. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work comprehensively evaluating distillation objectives in both settings. We show that attention transfer gives the best performance overall. We also study the impact of layer choice when initializing the student from the teacher layers, finding a significant impact on the performance in task-specific distillation. For vanilla KD and hidden states transfer, initialisation with lower layers of the teacher gives a considerable improvement over higher layers, especially on the task of QNLI (up to an absolute percentage change of 17.8 in accuracy). Attention transfer behaves consistently under different initialisation settings. We release our code as an efficient transformer-based model distillation framework for further studies.

Abstract: AbstractSelf-supervised knowledge-graph completion (KGC) relies on estimating a scoring model over (entity, relation, entity)-tuples, for example, by embedding an initial knowledge graph. Prediction quality can be improved by calibrating the scoring model, typically by adjusting the prediction thresholds using manually annotated examples. In this paper, we attempt for the first time cold-start calibration for KGC, where no annotated examples exist initially for calibration, and only a limited number of tuples can be selected for annotation. Our new method ACTC finds good per-relation thresholds efficiently based on a limited set of annotated tuples. Additionally to a few annotated tuples, ACTC also leverages unlabeled tuples by estimating their correctness with Logistic Regression or Gaussian Process classifiers. We also experiment with different methods for selecting candidate tuples for annotation: density-based and random selection. Experiments with five scoring models and an oracle annotator show an improvement of 7% points when using ACTC in the challenging setting with an annotation budget of only 10 tuples, and an average improvement of 4% points over different budgets.

Abstract: AbstractGiven its effectiveness on knowledge-intensive natural language processing tasks, dense retrieval models have become increasingly popular. Specifically, the de-facto architecture for open-domain question answering uses two isomorphic encoders that are initialized from the same pretrained model but separately parameterized for questions and passages. This biencoder architecture is parameter-inefficient in that there is no parameter sharing between encoders. Further, recent studies show that such dense retrievers underperform BM25 in various settings. We thus propose a new architecture, Task-Aware Specialization for dEnse Retrieval (TASER), which enables parameter sharing by interleaving shared and specialized blocks in a single encoder. Our experiments on five question answering datasets show that TASER can achieve superior accuracy, surpassing BM25, while using about 60% of the parameters as bi-encoder dense retrievers. In out-of-domain evaluations, TASER is also empirically more robust than bi-encoder dense retrievers. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/taser.

Abstract: AbstractEncoding long sequences in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a challenging problem. Though recent pretraining language models achieve satisfying performances in many NLP tasks, they are still restricted by a pre-defined maximum length, making them challenging to be extended to longer sequences. So some recent works utilize hierarchies to model long sequences. However, most of them apply sequential models for upper hierarchies, suffering from long dependency issues. In this paper, we alleviate these issues through a graph-based method. We first chunk the sequence with a fixed length to model the sentence-level information. We then leverage graphs to model intra- and cross-sentence correlations with a new attention mechanism. Additionally, due to limited standard benchmarks for long document classification (LDC), we propose a new challenging benchmark, totaling six datasets with up to 53k samples and 4034 average tokens’ length. Evaluation shows our model surpasses competitive baselines by 2.6% in F1 score, and 4.8% on the longest sequence dataset. Our method is shown to outperform hierarchical sequential models with better performance and scalability, especially for longer sequences.

Abstract: AbstractLarge-scale pre-trained language models such as BERT are popular solutions for text classification. Due to the superior performance of these advanced methods, nowadays, people often directly train them for a few epochs and deploy the obtained model. In this opinion paper, we point out that this way may only sometimes get satisfactory results. We argue the importance of running a simple baseline like linear classifiers on bag-of-words features along with advanced methods. First, for many text data, linear methods show competitive performance, high efficiency, and robustness. Second, advanced models such as BERT may only achieve the best results if properly applied. Simple baselines help to confirm whether the results of advanced models are acceptable. Our experimental results fully support these points.

Abstract: AbstractTransformers have impressive generalization capabilities on tasks with a fixed context length. However, they fail to generalize to sequences of arbitrary length, even for seemingly simple tasks such as duplicating a string. Moreover, simply training on longer sequences is inefficient due to the quadratic computation complexity of the global attention mechanism. In this work, we demonstrate that this failure mode is linked to positional encodings being out-of-distribution for longer sequences (even for relative encodings) and introduce a novel family of positional encodings that can overcome this problem. Concretely, our randomized positional encoding scheme simulates the positions of longer sequences and randomly selects an ordered subset to fit the sequence’s length. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of 6000 models across 15 algorithmic reasoning tasks shows that our method allows Transformers to generalize to sequences of unseen length (increasing test accuracy by 12.0% on average).

Abstract: AbstractIn this paper, we propose a table and image generation task to verify how the knowledge about entities acquired from natural language is retained in Vision & Language (V & L) models. This task consists of two parts: the first is to generate a table containing knowledge about an entity and its related image, and the second is to generate an image from an entity with a caption and a table containing related knowledge of the entity. In both tasks, the model must know the entities used to perform the generation properly. We created the Wikipedia Table and Image Generation (WikiTIG) dataset from about 200,000 infoboxes in English Wikipedia articles to perform the proposed tasks. We evaluated the performance on the tasks with respect to the above research question using the V & L model OFA, which has achieved state-of-the-art results in multiple tasks. Experimental results show that OFA forgets part of its entity knowledge by pre-training as a complement to improve the performance of image related tasks.

Abstract: AbstractNeural QCFG is a grammar-based sequence-to-sequence model with strong inductive biases on hierarchical structures. It excels in interpretability and generalization but suffers from expensive inference. In this paper, we study two low-rank variants of Neural QCFG for faster inference with different trade-offs between efficiency and expressiveness. Furthermore, utilizing the symbolic interface provided by the grammar, we introduce two soft constraints over tree hierarchy and source coverage. We experiment with various datasets and find that our models outperform vanilla Neural QCFG in most settings.

Abstract: AbstractTense inconsistency frequently occurs in machine translation. However, there are few criteria to assess the model’s mastery of tense prediction from a linguistic perspective. In this paper, we present a parallel tense test set, containing French-English 552 utterances. We also introduce a corresponding benchmark, tense prediction accuracy. With the tense test set and the benchmark, researchers are able to measure the tense consistency performance of machine translation systems for the first time.

Abstract: AbstractWe present a dataset and classifier for detecting the language of white supremacist extremism, a growing issue in online hate speech. Our weakly supervised classifier is trained on large datasets of text from explicitly white supremacist domains paired with neutral and anti-racist data from similar domains. We demonstrate that this approach improves generalization performance to new domains. Incorporating anti-racist texts as counterexamples to white supremacist language mitigates bias.

Abstract: AbstractEnergy-based models (EBMs) have gained popularity for controlled text generation due to their high applicability to a wide range of constraints. However, sampling from EBMs is non-trivial, as it often requires a large number of iterations to converge to plausible text, which slows down the decoding process and makes it less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose BOLT, which relies on tunable biases to directly adjust the language model’s output logits. Unlike prior work, BOLT maintains the generator’s autoregressive nature to assert a strong control on token-wise conditional dependencies and overall fluency, and thus converges faster. When compared with state-of-the-arts on controlled generation tasks using both soft constraints (e.g., sentiment control) and hard constraints (e.g., keyword-guided topic control), BOLT demonstrates significantly improved efficiency and fluency. On sentiment control, BOLT is 7x faster than competitive baselines, and more fluent in 74.4% of the evaluation samples according to human judges.

Abstract: AbstractAutomated completion of open knowledge bases (Open KBs), which are constructed from triples of the form (subject phrase, relation phrase, object phrase), obtained via open information extraction (Open IE) system, are useful for discovering novel facts that may not be directly present in the text. However, research in Open KB completion (Open KBC) has so far been limited to resource-rich languages like English. Using the latest advances in multilingual Open IE, we construct the first multilingual Open KBC dataset, called mOKB6, containing facts from Wikipedia in six languages (including English). Improvingthe previous Open KB construction pipeline by doing multilingual coreference resolution andkeeping only entity-linked triples, we create a dense Open KB. We experiment with several models for the task and observe a consistent benefit of combining languages with the help of shared embedding space as well as translations of facts. We also observe that current multilingual models struggle to remember facts seen in languages of different scripts.

Abstract: AbstractAccurate neural models are much less efficient than non-neural models and are useless for processing billions of social media posts or handling user queries in real time with a limited budget. This study revisits the fastest pattern-based NLP methods to make them as accurate as possible, thus yielding a strikingly simple yet surprisingly accurate morphological analyzer for Japanese. The proposed method induces reliable patterns from a morphological dictionary and annotated data. Experimental results on two standard datasets confirm that the method exhibits comparable accuracy to learning-based baselines, while boasting a remarkable throughput of over 1,000,000 sentences per second on a single modern CPU.

Abstract: AbstractHuman communication often involves information gaps between the interlocutors. For example, in an educational dialogue a student often provides an answer that is incomplete, and there is a gap between this answer and the perfect one expected by the teacher. Successful dialogue then hinges on the teacher asking about this gap in an effective manner, thus creating a rich and interactive educational experience. We focus on the problem of generating such gap-focused questions (GFQs) automatically. We define the task, highlight key desired aspects of a good GFQ, and propose a model that satisfies these. Finally, we provide an evaluation by human annotators of our generated questions compared against human generated ones, demonstrating competitive performance.

Abstract: AbstractText detoxification has the potential to mitigate the harms of toxicity by rephrasing text to remove offensive meaning, but subtle toxicity remains challenging to tackle. We introduce MaRCo, a detoxification algorithm that combines controllable generation and text rewriting methods using a Product of Experts with autoencoder language models (LMs). MaRCo uses likelihoods under a non-toxic LM (expert) and a toxic LM (anti-expert) to find candidate words to mask and potentially replace. We evaluate our method on several subtle toxicity and microaggressions datasets, and show that it not only outperforms baselines on automatic metrics, but MaRCo’s rewrites are preferred 2.1 times more in human evaluation. Its applicability to instances of subtle toxicity is especially promising, demonstrating a path forward for addressing increasingly elusive online hate.

Abstract: AbstractAfter just a few hundred training updates, a standard probabilistic model for language generation has likely not yet learnt many semantic or syntactic rules of natural language, making it difficult to estimate the probability distribution over next tokens. Yet around this point, these models have identified a simple, loss-minimising behaviour: to output the unigram distribution of the target training corpus. The use of such a heuristic raises the question: Can we initialise our models with this behaviour and save precious compute resources and model capacity? Here we show that we can effectively endow standard neural language generation models with a separate module that reflects unigram frequency statistics as prior knowledge, simply by initialising the bias term in a model’s final linear layer with the log-unigram distribution. We use neural machine translation as a test bed for this simple technique and observe that it: (i) improves learning efficiency; (ii) achieves better overall performance; and perhaps most importantly (iii) appears to disentangle strong frequency effects by encouraging the model to specialise in non-frequency-related aspects of language.

Abstract: AbstractHigh-quality and high-coverage rule sets are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion (NS-KGC) models, because they form the basis of all symbolic inferences. Recent literature builds neural models for generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they struggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple augmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive forms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent relations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune potentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five ruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently improve results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using rules without augmentations.

Abstract: AbstractRecent studies show that large-scale pre-trained language models could be efficaciously adapted to particular tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. The trained lightweight set of parameters, such as adapters, can be easily stored and shared as a capability equipped with the corresponding models. Owning many lightweight parameters, we focus on transferring them between tasks to acquire an improvement in performance of new tasks, the key point of which is to obtain the similarity between tasks. In this paper, we explore 5 parameter-efficient weight ensembling methods to achieve such transferability and verify the effectiveness of them. These methods extract the information of datasets and trained lightweight parameters from different perspectives to obtain the similarity between tasks, and weight the existing lightweight parameters according to the comparability to acquire a suitable module for the initialization of new tasks. We apply them to three parameter-efficient tuning methods and test them on a wide set of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that our methods show an improvement of 5%~8% over baselines and could largely facilitate task-level knowledge transfer.

Abstract: AbstractExplanations of neural models aim to reveal a model’s decision-making process for its predictions. However, recent work shows that current methods giving explanations such as saliency maps or counterfactuals can be misleading, as they are prone to present reasons that are unfaithful to the model’s inner workings. This work explores the challenging question of evaluating the faithfulness of natural language explanations (NLEs). To this end, we present two tests. First, we propose a counterfactual input editor for inserting reasons that lead to counterfactual predictions but are not reflected by the NLEs. Second, we reconstruct inputs from the reasons stated in the generated NLEs and check how often they lead to the same predictions. Our tests can evaluate emerging NLE models, proving a fundamental tool in the development of faithful NLEs.

Abstract: AbstractReasoning is one of the most important elements in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), specifically when it comes to Abductive and counterfactual reasoning. In order to introduce these capabilities of reasoning in Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, there have been recent advances towards training NLP models to better perform on two main tasks - Abductive Natural Language Inference (alphaNLI) and Abductive Natural Language Generation Task (alphaNLG). This paper proposes CoGen, a model for both alphaNLI and alphaNLG tasks that employ a novel approach of combining the temporal commonsense reasoning for each observation (before and after a real hypothesis) from pre-trained models with contextual filtering for training. Additionally, we use state-of-the-art semantic entailment to filter out the contradictory hypothesis during the inference. Our experimental results show that CoGen outperforms current models and set a new state of the art in regards to alphaNLI and alphaNLG tasks. We make the source code of CoGen model publicly available for reproducibility and to facilitate relevant future research.

Abstract: AbstractMultimodal relation extraction (MRE) is the task of identifying the semantic relationships between two entities based on the context of the sentence image pair. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches mainly focused on modeling the retrieved textual knowledge, but this may not be able to accurately identify complex relations. To improve the prediction, this research proposes to retrieve textual and visual evidence based on the object, sentence, and whole image. We further develop a novel approach to synthesize the object-level, image-level, and sentence-level information for better reasoning between the same and different modalities. Extensive experiments and analyses show that the proposed method is able to effectively select and compare evidence across modalities and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: AbstractWidespread disparities in clinical outcomes exist between different demographic groups in the United States. A new line of work in medical sociology has demonstrated physicians often use stigmatizing language in electronic medical records within certain groups, such as black patients, which may exacerbate disparities. In this study, we characterize these instances at scale using a series of domain-informed NLP techniques. We highlight important differences between this task and analogous bias-related tasks studied within the NLP community (e.g., classifying microaggressions). Our study establishes a foundation for NLP researchers to contribute timely insights to a problem domain brought to the forefront by recent legislation regarding clinical documentation transparency. We release data, code, and models.

Abstract: AbstractExtractive and abstractive summarization designs have historically been fragmented, limiting the benefits that often arise from compatible model architectures. In this paper, we explore the potential synergies of modeling extractive summarization with an abstractive summarization system and propose three novel inference algorithms using the sequence-to-sequence architecture. We evaluate them on the CNN & Dailymail dataset and show that recent advancements in abstractive system designs enable abstractive systems to not only compete, but even surpass the performance of extractive systems with custom architectures. To our surprise, abstractive systems achieve this without being exposed to extractive oracle summaries and, therefore, for the first time allow a single model to produce both abstractive and extractive summaries. This evidence questions our fundamental understanding of extractive system design, and the necessity for extractive labels while pathing the way for promising research directions in hybrid models.

Meloni et al (2021) achieved the state-of-the-art on Latin protoform reconstruction with an RNN-based encoder-decoder with attention model. We update their model with the state-of-the-art seq2seq model: the Transformer.

Abstract: AbstractSocietal biases present in pre-trained large language models are a critical issue as these models have been shown to propagate biases in countless downstream applications, rendering them unfair towards specific groups of people. Since large-scale retraining of these models from scratch is both time and compute-expensive, a variety of approaches have been previously proposed that de-bias a pre-trained model. While the majority of current state-of-the-art debiasing methods focus on changes to the training regime, in this paper, we propose data intervention strategies as a powerful yet simple technique to reduce gender bias in pre-trained models. Specifically, we empirically show that by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on only 10 debiased (intervened) training examples, the tendency to favor any gender is significantly reduced. Since our proposed method only needs a few training examples, we argue that our few-shot de-biasing approach is highly feasible and practical. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our de-biasing technique performs better than competitive state-of-the-art baselines with minimal loss in language modeling ability.

Abstract: AbstractPrivacy policies provide individuals with information about their rights and how their personal information is handled. Natural language understanding (NLU) technologies can support individuals and practitioners to understand better privacy practices described in lengthy and complex documents. However, existing efforts that use NLU technologies are limited by processing the language in a way exclusive to a single task focusing on certain privacy practices. To this end, we introduce the Privacy Policy Language Understanding Evaluation (PLUE) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the privacy policy language understanding across various tasks. We also collect a large corpus of privacy policies to enable privacy policy domain-specific language model pre-training. We evaluate several generic pre-trained language models and continue pre-training them on the collected corpus. We demonstrate that domain-specific continual pre-training offers performance improvements across all tasks. The code and models are released at https://github.com/JFChi/PLUE.

Abstract: AbstractVision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance of many vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval, visual entailment, and visual reasoning. The pre-training mostly utilizes lexical databases and image queries in English. Previous work has demonstrated that the pre-training in English does not transfer well to other languages in a zero-shot setting. However, multilingual pre-trained language models (MPLM) have excelled at a variety of single-modal language tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient approach to adapt VLP to unseen languages using MPLM.We utilize a cross-lingual contextualised token embeddings alignment approach to train text encoders for non-English languages. Our approach does not require image input and primarily uses machine translation, eliminating the need for target language data. Our evaluation across three distinct tasks (image-text retrieval, visual entailment, and natural language visual reasoning) demonstrates that this approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multilingual vision-language models without requiring large parallel corpora.

Abstract: AbstractUnsupervised commonsense reasoning (UCR) is becoming increasingly popular as the construction of commonsense reasoning datasets is expensive, and they are inevitably limited in their scope. A popular approach to UCR is to fine-tune language models with external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), but this usually requires a large number of training examples. In this paper, we propose to transform the downstream multiple choice question answering task into a simpler binary classification task by ranking all candidate answers according to their reasonableness. To this end, for training the model, we convert the knowledge graph triples into reasonable and unreasonable texts. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on various multiple choice question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, compared with existing UCR approaches using KGs, ours is less data hungry.

Abstract: AbstractThrough the use of first name substitution experiments, prior research has demonstrated the tendency of social commonsense reasoning models to systematically exhibit social biases along the dimensions of race, ethnicity, and gender (An et al., 2023). Demographic attributes of first names, however, are strongly correlated with corpus frequency and tokenization length, which may influence model behavior independent of or in addition to demographic factors. In this paper, we conduct a new series of first name substitution experiments that measures the influence of these factors while controlling for the others. We find that demographic attributes of a name (race, ethnicity, and gender) and name tokenization length are both factors that systematically affect the behavior of social commonsense reasoning models.

Abstract: AbstractSyntactic probing methods have been used to examine whether and how pre-trained language models (PLMs) encode syntactic features. However, the probing methods are usually biased by the PLMs’ memorization of common word co-occurrences, even if they do not form syntactic relations. This paper presents a random-word-substitution and random-label-matching control task to reduce these biases and improve the robustness of syntactic probing methods. Our control tasks are also shown to notably improve the consistency of probing results between different probing methods and make the methods more robust with respect to the text attributes of the probing instances. Our control tasks make syntactic probing methods better at reconstructing syntactic features and more generalizable to unseen text domains. Our experiments show that our proposed control tasks are effective on different PLMs, probing methods, and syntactic features.

Abstract: AbstractIn this work, we address the NER problem by splitting it into two logical sub-tasks: (1) Span Detection which simply extracts entity mention spans irrespective of entity type; (2) Span Classification which classifies the spans into their entity types. Further, we formulate both sub-tasks as question-answering (QA) problems and produce two leaner models which can be optimized separately for each sub-task. Experiments with four cross-domain datasets demonstrate that this two-step approach is both effective and time efficient. Our system, SplitNER outperforms baselines on OntoNotes5.0, WNUT17 and a cybersecurity dataset and gives on-par performance on BioNLP13CG. In all cases, it achieves a significant reduction in training time compared to its QA baseline counterpart. The effectiveness of our system stems from fine-tuning the BERT model twice, separately for span detection and classification. The source code can be found at https://github.com/c3sr/split-ner.

Abstract: AbstractLanguage models have recently broken into the public consciousness with the release of the wildly popular ChatGPT. Commentators have argued that language models could replace search engines, make college essays obsolete, or even write academic research papers. All of these tasks rely on accuracy of specialized information which can be difficult to assess for non-experts. Using 10 domain experts across science and culture, we provide an initial assessment of the coherence, conciseness, accuracy, and sourcing of two language models across 100 expert-written questions. While we find the results are consistently cohesive and concise, we find that they are mixed in their accuracy. These results raise questions of the role language models should play in general-purpose and expert knowledge seeking.

Abstract: AbstractFor humans, language production and comprehension is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of sentences. In natural language processing, past work has questioned how effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods—far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated. We call this phenomenon structural grokking. On multiple datasets, structural grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth: intermediate-depth models generalize better than both very deep and very shallow transformers. When analyzing the relationship between model-internal properties and grokking, we find that optimal depth for grokking can be identified using the tree-structuredness metric of CITATION. Overall, our work provides strong evidence that, with extended training, vanilla transformers discover and use hierarchical structure.

Abstract: AbstractAdapters have emerged as a parameter-efficient Transformer-based framework for cross-lingual transfer by inserting lightweight language-specific modules (language adapters) and task-specific modules (task adapters) within pretrained multilingual models. Zero-shot transfer is enabled by pairing the language adapter in the target language with an appropriate task adapter in a source language. If our target languages are known apriori, we explore how zero-shot transfer can be further improved within the adapter framework by utilizing unlabeled text during task-specific finetuning. We construct language-specific subspaces using standard linear algebra constructs and selectively project source-language representations into the target language subspace during task-specific finetuning using two schemes. Our experiments on three cross-lingual tasks, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) yield consistent benefits compared to adapter baselines over a wide variety of target languages with up to 11% relative improvement in NER, 2% relative improvement in QA and 5% relative improvement in NLI.

Abstract: AbstractAnswer Sentence Selection (AS2) is a core component for building an accurate Question Answering pipeline. AS2 models rank a set of candidate sentences based on how likely they answer a given question. The state of the art in AS2 exploits pre-trained transformers by transferring them on large annotated datasets, while using local contextual information around the candidate sentence. In this paper, we propose three pre-training objectives designed to mimic the downstream fine-tuning task of contextual AS2. This allows for specializing LMs when fine-tuning for contextual AS2. Our experiments on three public and two large-scale industrial datasets show that our pre-training approaches (applied to RoBERTa and ELECTRA) can improve baseline contextual AS2 accuracy by up to 8% on some datasets.

Abstract: AbstractRadiology report summarization (RRS) is a growing area of research. Given the Findings section of a radiology report, the goal is to generate a summary (called an Impression section) that highlights the key observations and conclusions of the radiology study. However, RRS currently faces essential limitations. First, many prior studies conduct experiments on private datasets, preventing reproduction of results and fair comparisons across different systems and solutions. Second, most prior approaches are evaluated solely on chest X-rays. To address these limitations, we propose a dataset (MIMIC-RRS) involving three new modalities and seven new anatomies based on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-CXR datasets. We then conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of models both within and across modality-anatomy pairs in MIMIC-RRS. In addition, we evaluate their clinical efficacy via RadGraph, a factual correctness metric.

Abstract: AbstractElectronic phenotyping entails using electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients with specific health outcomes and determine when those outcomes occurred. Unstructured clinical notes, which contain a vast amount of information, are a valuable resource for electronic phenotyping. However, traditional methods, such as rule-based labeling functions or neural networks, require significant manual effort to tune and may not generalize well to multiple indications. To address these challenges, we propose HyDE (hybrid diagnosis extractor). HyDE is a simple framework for electronic phenotyping that integrates labeling functions and a disease-agnostic neural network to assign diagnoses to patients. By training HyDE’s model to correct predictions made by labeling functions, we are able to disambiguate hypertension true positives and false positives with a supervised area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.85. We extend this hypertension-trained model to zero-shot evaluation of four other diseases, generating AUPRC values ranging from 0.82 - 0.95 and outperforming a labeling function baseline by 44 points in F1 score and a Word2Vec baseline by 24 points in F1 score on average. Furthermore, we demonstrate a speedup of >4x by pruning the length of inputs into our language model to ~2.3% of the full clinical notes, with negligible impact to the AUPRC. HyDE has the potential to improve the efficiency and efficacy of interpreting large-scale unstructured clinical notes for accurate EHR phenotyping.

Abstract: AbstractLarge-scale language models have shown the ability to adapt to a new task via conditioning on a few demonstrations (i.e., in-context learning). However, in the vision-language domain, most large-scale pre-trained vision-language (VL) models do not possess the ability to conduct in-context learning. How can we enable in-context learning for VL models? In this paper, we study an interesting hypothesis: can we transfer the in-context learning ability from the language domain to the VL domain? Specifically, we first meta-trains a language model to perform in-context learning on NLP tasks (as in MetaICL); then we transfer this model to perform VL tasks by attaching a visual encoder. Our experiments suggest that indeed in-context learning ability can be transferred cross modalities: our model considerably improves the in-context learning capability on VL tasks and can even compensate for the size of the model significantly. On VQA, OK-VQA, and GQA, our method could outperform the baseline model while having ~20 times fewer parameters.

Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, word embeddings have been widely used to measure biases in texts. Even if they have proven to be effective in detecting a wide variety of biases, metrics based on word embeddings lack transparency and interpretability. We analyze an alternative PMI-based metric to quantify biases in texts. It can be expressed as a function of conditional probabilities, which provides a simple interpretation in terms of word co-occurrences. We also prove that it can be approximated by an odds ratio, which allows estimating confidence intervals and statistical significance of textual biases. This approach produces similar results to metrics based on word embeddings when capturing gender gaps of the real world embedded in large corpora.

Abstract: AbstractAugmenting language models with a retrieval mechanism has been shown to significantly improve their performance while keeping the number of parameters low. Retrieval-augmented models commonly rely on a semantic retrieval mechanism based on the similarity between dense representations of the query chunk and potential neighbors. In this paper, we study the state-of-the-art Retro model and observe that its performance gain is better explained by surface-level similarities, such as token overlap. Inspired by this, we replace the semantic retrieval in Retro with a surface-level method based on BM25, obtaining a significant reduction in perplexity. As full BM25 retrieval can be computationally costly for large datasets, we also apply it in a re-ranking scenario, gaining part of the perplexity reduction with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: AbstractLearning semantically meaningful representations from scientific documents can facilitate academic literature search and improve performance of recommendation systems. Pretrained language models have been shown to learn rich textual representations, yet they cannot provide powerful document-level representations for scientific articles. We propose MIReAD, a simple method that learns highquality representations of scientific papers by fine-tuning transformer model to predict the target journal class based on the abstract. We train MIReAD on more than 500,000 PubMed and arXiv abstracts across over 2,000 journal classes. We show that MIReAD produces representations that can be used for similar papers retrieval, topic categorization and literature search. Our proposed approach outperforms six existing models for representation learning on scientific documents across four evaluation standards.

Abstract: AbstractWhile recent works have been considerably improving the quality of the natural language explanations (NLEs) generated by a model to justify its predictions, there is very limited research in detecting and alleviating inconsistencies among generated NLEs. In this work, we leverage external knowledge bases to significantly improve on an existing adversarial attack for detecting inconsistent NLEs. We apply our attack to high-performing NLE models and show that models with higher NLE quality do not necessarily generate fewer inconsistencies. Moreover, we propose an off-the-shelf mitigation method to alleviate inconsistencies by grounding the model into external background knowledge. Our method decreases the inconsistencies of previous high-performing NLE models as detected by our attack.

Abstract: AbstractPredicting how a user responds to news events enables important applications such as allowing intelligent agents or content producers to estimate the effect on different communities and revise unreleased messages to prevent unexpected bad outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. We present a new task, Response Forecasting on Personas for News Media, to estimate the response a persona (characterizing an individual or a group) might have upon seeing a news message. Compared to the previous efforts which only predict generic comments to news, the proposed task not only introduces personalization in the modeling but also predicts the sentiment polarity and intensity of each response. This enables more accurate and comprehensive inference on the mental state of the persona. Meanwhile, the generated sentiment dimensions make the evaluation and application more reliable. We create the first benchmark dataset, which consists of 13,357 responses to 3,847 news headlines from Twitter. We further evaluate the SOTA neural language models with our dataset. The empirical results suggest that the included persona attributes are helpful for the performance of all response dimensions. Our analysis shows that the best-performing models are capable of predicting responses that are consistent with the personas, and as a byproduct, the task formulation also enables many interesting applications in the analysis of social network groups and their opinions, such as the discovery of extreme opinion groups.

Abstract: AbstractSemantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree to which the underlying semantics of paired sentences are equivalent. State-of-the-art methods for STS task use language models to encode sentences into embeddings. However, these embeddings are limited in representing semantics because they mix all the semantic information together in fixed-length vectors, which are difficult to recover and lack explainability. This paper presents a token-level matching inference algorithm, which can be applied on top of any language model to improve its performance on STS task. Our method calculates pairwise token-level similarity and token matching scores, and then aggregates them with pretrained token weights to produce sentence similarity. Experimental results on seven STS datasets show that our method improves the performance of almost all language models, with up to 12.7% gain in Spearman’s correlation. We also demonstrate that our method is highly explainable and computationally efficient.

Abstract: AbstractWe introduce a method that self trains (or bootstraps) neural relation and explanation classifiers. Our work expands the supervised approach of CITATION, which jointly trains a relation classifier with an explanation classifier that identifies context words important for the relation at hand, to semi-supervised scenarios. In particular, our approach iteratively converts the explainable models’ outputs to rules and applies them to unlabeled text to produce new annotations. Our evaluation on the TACRED dataset shows that our method outperforms the rule-based model we started from by 15 F1 points, outperforms traditional self-training that relies just on the relation classifier by 5 F1 points, and performs comparatively with the prompt-based approach of CITATION (without requiring an additional natural language inference component).

Abstract: AbstractAddressee recognition aims to identify addressees in multi-party conversations. While state-of-the-art addressee recognition models have achieved promising performance, they still suffer from the issue of robustness when applied in real-world scenes. When exposed to a noisy environment, these models regard the noise as input and identify the addressee in a pre-given addressee closed set, while the addressees of the noise do not belong to this closed set, thus leading to the wrong identification of addressee. To this end, we propose a Robust Addressee Recognition (RAR) method, which discrete the addressees into a character codebook, making it able to represent open set addressees and robust in a noisy environment. Experimental results show that the introduction of the addressee character codebook helps to represent the open set addressees and highly improves the robustness of addressee recognition even if the input is noise.

Abstract: AbstractPrevious work in phonetically-grounded language generation has mainly focused on domains such as lyrics and poetry. In this paper, we present work on the generation of tongue twisters - a form of language that is required to be phonetically conditioned to maximise sound overlap, whilst maintaining semantic consistency with an input topic, and still being grammatically correct. We present TwistList, a large annotated dataset of tongue twisters, consisting of 2.1K+ human-authored examples. We additionally present several benchmark systems (referred to as TwisterMisters) for the proposed task of tongue twister generation, including models that both do and do not require training on in-domain data. We present the results of automatic and human evaluation to demonstrate the performance ofexisting mainstream pre-trained models in this task with limited (or no) task specific training and data, and no explicit phonetic knowledge. We find that the task of tongue twister generation is challenging for models under these conditions, yet some models are still capable of generating acceptable examples of this language type.

Abstract: AbstractMeasuring semantic change has thus far remained a task where methods using contextual embeddings have struggled to improve upon simpler techniques relying only on static word vectors. Moreover, many of the previously proposed approaches suffer from downsides related to scalability and ease of interpretation. We present a simplified approach to measuring semantic change using contextual embeddings, relying only on the most probable substitutes for masked terms. Not only is this approach directly interpretable, it is also far more efficient in terms of storage, achieves superior average performance across the most frequently cited datasets for this task, and allows for more nuanced investigation of change than is possible with static word vectors.

Abstract: AbstractIn this study, we create a CConS (Counter-commonsense Contextual Size comparison) dataset to investigate how physical commonsense affects the contextualized size comparison task; the proposed dataset consists of both contexts that fit physical commonsense and those that do not. This dataset tests the ability of language models to predict the size relationship between objects under various contexts generated from our curated noun list and templates. We measure the ability of several masked language models and encoder-decoder models. The results show that while large language models can use prepositions such as “in” and “into” in the provided context to infer size relationships, they fail to use verbs and thus make incorrect judgments led by their prior physical commonsense.

Abstract: AbstractRecent years have brought great advances into solving morphological tasks, mostly due to powerful neural models applied to various tasks as (re)inflection and analysis. Yet, such morphological tasks cannot be considered solved, especially when little training data is available or when generalizing to previously unseen lemmas. This work explores effects on performance obtained through various ways in which morphological models get access to sub-character phonological features that are often the targets of morphological processes. We design two methods to achieve this goal: one that leaves models as is but manipulates the data to include features instead of characters, and another that manipulates models to take phonological features into account when building representations for phonemes. We elicit phonemic data from standard graphemic data using language-specific grammars for languages with shallow grapheme-to-phoneme mapping, and we experiment with two reinflection models over eight languages. Our results show that our methods yield comparable results to the grapheme-based baseline overall, with minor improvements in some of the languages. All in all, we conclude that patterns in character distributions are likely to allow models to infer the underlying phonological characteristics, even when phonemes are not explicitly represented.

Abstract: AbstractTraditional machine translation evaluation relies on reference written by humans. While reference-free evaluation gets rid of the constraints of labor-intensive annotations, which can pivot easily to new domains and is more scalable. In this paper, we propose a reference-free evaluation approach that characterizes evaluation as two aspects: (1) fluency: how well the translated text conforms to normal human language usage; (2) faithfulness: how well the translated text reflects the source data. We further split the faithfulness into word-level and sentence-level. Extensive experiments spanning WMT18/19/21 Metrics segment-level daRR and MQM datasets demonstrate that our proposed reference-free approach, ReFreeEval, outperforms SOTA reference-fee metrics like YiSi-2.

Abstract: AbstractAn important problem of the sequence-to-sequence neural models widely used in abstractive summarization is exposure bias. To alleviate this problem, re-ranking systems have been applied in recent years. Despite some performance improvements, this approach remains underexplored. Previous works have mostly specified the rank through the ROUGE score and aligned candidate summaries, but there can be quite a large gap between the lexical overlap metric and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel training method in which a re-ranker balances the lexical and semantic quality. We further newly define false positives in ranking and present a strategy to reduce their influence. Experiments on the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets show that our method can estimate the meaning of summaries without seriously degrading the lexical aspect. More specifically, it achieves an 89.67 BERTScore on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, reaching new state-of-the-art performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jeewoo1025/BalSum.

Abstract: AbstractThe recent emergence of Neuro-Symbolic Agent (NeSA) approaches to natural language-based interactions calls for the investigation of model-based approaches. In contrast to model-free approaches, which existing NeSAs take, learning an explicit world model has an interesting potential especially in the explainability, which is one of the key selling points of NeSA. To learn useful world models, we leverage one of the recent neuro-symbolic architectures, Logical Neural Networks (LNN). Here, we describe a method that can learn neuro-symbolic world models on the TextWorld-Commonsense set of games. We then show how this can be improved further by taking inspiration from the concept of proprioception, but for conversation. This is done by enhancing the internal logic state with a memory of previous actions while also guiding future actions by augmenting the learned model with constraints based on this memory. This greatly improves the game-solving agents performance in a TextWorld setting, where the advantage over the baseline is an 85% average steps reduction and x2.3 average score.

Abstract: AbstractRecently it has been shown that state-of-the-art NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where the predictions of a model can be drastically altered by slight modifications to the input (such as synonym substitutions). While several defense techniques have been proposed, and adapted, to the discrete nature of text adversarial attacks, the benefits of general-purpose regularization methods such as label smoothing for language models, have not been studied. In this paper, we study the adversarial robustness provided by label smoothing strategies in foundational models for diverse NLP tasks in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our experiments show that label smoothing significantly improves adversarial robustness in pre-trained models like BERT, against various popular attacks. We also analyze the relationship between prediction confidence and robustness, showing that label smoothing reduces over-confident errors on adversarial examples.

Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, there has been significant progress in developing pre-trained language models for NLP. However, these models often struggle when fine-tuned on small datasets. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various adaptation approaches. Prompt-based tuning is arguably the most common way, especially for larger models. Previous research shows that adding contrastive learning to prompt-based fine-tuning is effective as it helps the model generate embeddings that are more distinguishable between classes, and it can also be more sample-efficient as the model learns from positive and negative examples simultaneously. One of the most important components of contrastive learning is data augmentation, but unlike computer vision, effective data augmentation for NLP is still challenging. This paper proposes LM-CPPF, Contrastive Paraphrasing-guided Prompt-based Fine-tuning of Language Models, which leverages prompt-based few-shot paraphrasing using generative language models, especially large language models such as GPT-3 and OPT-175B, for data augmentation. Our experiments on multiple text classification benchmarks show that this augmentation method outperforms other methods, such as easy data augmentation, back translation, and multiple templates.

Abstract: AbstractMultiple algorithms are known for efficiently calculating the prefix probability of a string under a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). Good algorithms for the problem have a runtime cubic in the length of the input string. However, some proposed algorithms are suboptimal with respect to the size of the grammar. This paper proposes a new speed-up of Jelinek and Lafferty’s (1991) algorithm, which runs in O(n3|N|3 + |N|4), where n is the input length and |N| is the number of non-terminals in the grammar. In contrast, our speed-up runs in O(n2|N|3 + n3|N|2).

Abstract: AbstractAutomatic sign language processing is gaining popularity in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research (Yin et al., 2021). In machine translation (MT) in particular, sign language translation based on glosses is a prominent approach. In this paper, we review recent works on neural gloss translation. We find that limitations of glosses in general and limitations of specific datasets are not discussed in a transparent manner and that there is no common standard for evaluation. To address these issues, we put forward concrete recommendations for future research on gloss translation. Our suggestions advocate awareness of the inherent limitations of gloss-based approaches, realistic datasets, stronger baselines and convincing evaluation.

Abstract: AbstractThe COVID-19 pandemic created a deluge of questionable and contradictory scientific claims about drug efficacy – an “infodemic” with lasting consequences for science and society. In this work, we argue that NLP models can help domain experts distill and understand the literature in this complex, high-stakes area. Our task is to automatically identify contradictory claims about COVID-19 drug efficacy. We frame this as a natural language inference problem and offer a new NLI dataset created by domain experts. The NLI framing allows us to create curricula combining existing datasets and our own. The resulting models are useful investigative tools. We provide a case study of how these models help a domain expert summarize and assess evidence concerning remdisivir and hydroxychloroquine.

Abstract: AbstractPre-trained transformer-based models have recently shown great performance when applied to Named Entity Recognition (NER). As the complexity of their self-attention mechanism prevents them from processing long documents at once, these models are usually applied in a sequential fashion. Such an approach unfortunately only incorporates local context and prevents leveraging global document context in long documents such as novels, which might hinder performance. In this article, we explore the impact of global document context, and its relationships with local context. We find that correctly retrieving global document context has a greater impact on performance than only leveraging local context, prompting for further research on how to better retrieve that context.

Abstract: AbstractSemantic proto-role labeling (SPRL) assigns properties to arguments based on a series of binary labels. While multiple studies have evaluated various approaches to SPRL, it has only been studied in-depth as a standalone task using gold predicate/argument pairs. How do SPRL systems perform as part of an information extraction pipeline? We model SPRL jointly with predicate-argument extraction using a deep transformer model. We find that proto-role labeling is surprisingly robust in this setting, with only a small decrease when using predicted arguments. We include a detailed analysis of each component of the joint system, and an error analysis to understand correlations in errors between system stages. Finally, we study the effects of annotation errors on SPRL.

Abstract: AbstractCurrent models for quotation attribution in literary novels assume varying levels of available information in their training and test data, which poses a challenge for in-the-wild inference. Here, we approach quotation attribution as a set of four interconnected sub-tasks: character identification, coreference resolution, quotation identification, and speaker attribution. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on each of these sub-tasks independently, using a large dataset of annotated coreferences and quotations in literary novels (the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus). We also train and evaluate models for the speaker attribution task in particular, showing that a simple sequential prediction model achieves accuracy scores on par with state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: AbstractWe present a framework that formulates visual question answering as modular code generation. In contrast to prior work on modular approaches to VQA, our approach requires no additional training and relies on pre-trained language models (LMs), visual models pre-trained on image-caption pairs, and fifty VQA examples used for in-context learning. The generated Python programs invoke and compose the outputs of the visual models using arithmetic and conditional logic. Our approach improves accuracy on the COVR dataset by at least 3% and on the GQA dataset by 2% compared to the few-shot baseline that does not employ code generation.

Abstract: AbstractWe present TBO, a new dataset for Target-based Offensive language identification. TBO contains post-level annotations regarding the harmfulness of an offensive post and token-level annotations comprising of the target and the offensive argument expression. Popular offensive language identification datasets for social media focus on annotation taxonomies only at the post level and more recently, some datasets have been released that feature only token-level annotations. TBO is an important resource that bridges the gap between post-level and token-level annotation datasets by introducing a single comprehensive unified annotation taxonomy. We use the TBO taxonomy to annotate post-level and token-level offensive language on English Twitter posts. We release an initial dataset of over 4,500 instances collected from Twitter and we carry out multiple experiments to compare the performance of different models trained and tested on TBO.

Abstract: AbstractWe describe a novel unsupervised approach to subtitle segmentation, based on pretrained masked language models, where line endings and subtitle breaks are predicted according to the likelihood of punctuation to occur at candidate segmentation points. Our approach obtained competitive results in terms of segmentation accuracy across metrics, while also fully preserving the original text and complying with length constraints. Although supervised models trained on in-domain data and with access to source audio information can provide better segmentation accuracy, our approach is highly portable across languages and domains and may constitute a robust off-the-shelf solution for subtitle segmentation.

Abstract: AbstractLarge-scale code generation models such as Copilot and CodeT5 have achieved impressive performance. However, libraries are upgraded or deprecated very frequently and re-training large-scale language models is computationally expensive. Therefore, Continual Learning (CL) is an important aspect that remains under-explored in the code domain. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called CodeTask-CL that covers a wide range of tasks, including code generation, translation, summarization, and refinement, with different input and output programming languages. Next, on our CodeTask-CL benchmark, we compare popular CL techniques from NLP and Vision domains. We find that effective methods like Prompt Pooling (PP) suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to the unstable training of the prompt selection mechanism caused by stark distribution shifts in coding tasks. We address this issue with our proposed method, Prompt Pooling with Teacher Forcing (PP-TF), that stabilizes training by enforcing constraints on the prompt selection mechanism and leads to a 21.54% improvement over Prompt Pooling. Along with the benchmark, we establish a training pipeline that can be used for CL on code models, which we believe can motivate further development of CL methods for code models.

Abstract: AbstractBuilding a system for morphological processing is a challenging task in morphologically complex languages like Arabic. Although there are some deep learning based models that achieve successful results, these models rely on a large amount of annotated data. Building such datasets, specially for some of the lower-resource Arabic dialects, is very difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. In addition, some parts of the annotated data do not contain useful information for training machine learning models. Active learning strategies allow the learner algorithm to select the most informative samples for annotation. There has been little research that focuses on applying active learning for morphological inflection and morphophonological processing. In this paper, we have proposed a deep active learning method for this task. Our experiments on Egyptian Arabic show that with only about 30% of annotated data, we achieve the same results as does the state-of-the-art model on the whole dataset.

Abstract: AbstractTextual representations based on pre-trained language models are key, especially in few-shot learning scenarios. What makes a representation good for text classification? Is it due to the geometric properties of the space or because it is well aligned with the task? We hypothesize the second claim. To test it, we develop a task alignment score based on hierarchical clustering that measures alignment at different levels of granularity. Our experiments on text classification validate our hypothesis by showing that task alignment can explain the classification performance of a given representation.

Abstract: AbstractCurrent pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on the understanding of real world. We tease these factors apart by leveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of tests from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from five pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge—however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.

Abstract: AbstractWe create publicly available language identification (LID) datasets and models in all 22 Indian languages listed in the Indian constitution in both native-script and romanized text. First, we create Bhasha-Abhijnaanam, a language identification test set for native-script as well as romanized text which spans all 22 Indic languages. We also train IndicLID, a language identifier for all the above-mentioned languages in both native and romanized script. For native-script text, it has better language coverage than existing LIDs and is competitive or better than other LIDs. IndicLID is the first LID for romanized text in Indian languages. Two major challenges for romanized text LID are the lack of training data and low-LID performance when languages are similar. We provide simple and effective solutions to these problems. In general, there has been limited work on romanized text in any language, and our findings are relevant to other languages that need romanized language identification. Our models are publicly available at https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicLID under open-source licenses. Our training and test sets are also publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4bharat/Bhasha-Abhijnaanam under open-source licenses.

Abstract: AbstractThis work examines the use of contradiction in natural language inference (NLI) for question answering (QA). Typically, NLI systems help answer questions by determining if a potential answer is entailed (supported) by some background context. But is it useful to also determine if an answer contradicts the context? We test this in two settings, multiple choice and extractive QA, and find that systems that incorporate contradiction can do slightly better than entailment-only systems on certain datasets. However, the best performances come from using contradiction, entailment, and QA model confidence scores together. This has implications for the deployment of QA systems in domains such as medicine and science where safety is an issue.

Abstract: AbstractAdaptive training approaches, widely used in sequence-to-sequence models, commonly reweigh the losses of different target tokens based on priors, e.g. word frequency. However, most of them do not consider the variation of learning difficulty in different training steps, and overly emphasize the learning of difficult one-hot labels, making the learning deterministic and sub-optimal. In response, we present Token-Level Self-Evolution Training (SE), a simple and effective dynamic training method to fully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on dynamically learning the under-explored tokens for each forward pass and adaptively regularizes the training by introducing a novel token-specific label smoothing approach. Empirically, SE yields consistent and significant improvements in three tasks, i.e. machine translation, summarization, and grammatical error correction. Encouragingly, we achieve averaging +0.93 BLEU improvement on three machine translation tasks. Analyses confirm that, besides improving lexical accuracy, SE enhances generation diversity and model generalization.

Abstract: AbstractIn this work, we empirically show that updating pretrained LMs (350M, 1.3B, 2.7B) with just a few steps of Gradient Ascent Post-training (GAP) on random, unlabeled text corpora enhances its zero-shot generalization capabilities across diverse NLP tasks. Specifically, we show that GAP can allow LMs to become comparable to 2-3x times larger LMs across 12 different NLP tasks. We also show that applying GAP on out-of-distribution corpora leads to the most reliable performance improvements. Our findings indicate that GAP can be a promising method for improving the generalization capability of LMs without any task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: AbstractLanguage identification (LID) is a fundamental step in many natural language processing pipelines. However, current LID systems are far from perfect, particularly on lower-resource languages. We present a LID model which achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.93 and a false positive rate of 0.033% across 201 languages, outperforming previous work. We achieve this by training on a curated dataset of monolingual data, which we audit manually to ensure reliability. We make both the model and the dataset available to the research community. Finally, we carry out detailed analysis into our model’s performance, both in comparison to existing open models and by language class.

We posit that if RTE models understand language, their predictions should be consistent across inputs that share the same meaning. We use the evaluation set to determine if RTE models’ predictions change when examples are paraphrased. In our experiments, contemporary models change their predictions on 8-16% of paraphrased examples, indicating that there is still room for improvement.

Abstract: AbstractModel ensemble has been in widespread use for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC), boosting model performance. We hypothesize that model ensemble based on the perplexity (PPL) computed by pre-trained language models (PLMs) should benefit the GEC system. To this end, we explore several ensemble strategies based on strong PLMs with four sophisticated single models. However, the performance does not improve but even gets worse after the PLM-based ensemble. This surprising result sets us doing a detailed analysis on the data and coming up with some insights on GEC. The human references of correct sentences is far from sufficient in the test data, and the gap between a correct sentence and an idiomatic one is worth our attention. Moreover, the PLM-based ensemble strategies provide an effective way to extend and improve GEC benchmark data. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JamyDon/PLM-based-CGEC-Model-Ensemble.

Abstract: AbstractImproving factual consistency of abstractive summarization has been a widely studied topic. However, most of the prior works on training factuality-aware models have ignored the negative effect it has on summary quality. We propose {pasted macro ‘MODEL’}name (i.e. Effective Factual Summarization), a candidate summary generation and ranking technique to improve summary factuality without sacrificing quality. We show that using a contrastive learning framework with our refined candidate summaries leads to significant gains on both factuality and similarity-based metrics. Specifically, we propose a ranking strategy in which we effectively combine two metrics, thereby preventing any conflict during training. Models trained using our approach show up to 6 points of absolute improvement over the base model with respect to FactCC on XSUM and 11 points on CNN/DM, without negatively affecting either similarity-based metrics or absractiveness.

Abstract: AbstractConditional language models still generate unfaithful output that is not supported by their input. These unfaithful generations jeopardize trust in real-world applications such as summarization or human-machine interaction, motivating a need for automatic faithfulness metrics. To implement such metrics, NLI models seem attractive, since they solve a strongly related task that comes with a wealth of prior research and data. But recent research suggests that NLI models require costly additional machinery to perform reliably across datasets, e.g., by running inference on a cartesian product of input and generated sentences, or supporting them with a question-generation/answering step. In this work we show that pure NLI models _can_ outperform more complex metrics when combining task-adaptive data augmentation with robust inference procedures. We propose: (1) Augmenting NLI training data toadapt NL inferences to the specificities of faithfulness prediction in dialogue;(2) Making use of both entailment and contradiction probabilities in NLI, and(3) Using Monte-Carlo dropout during inference. Applied to the TRUE benchmark, which combines faithfulness datasets across diverse domains and tasks, our approach strongly improves a vanilla NLI model and significantly outperforms previous work, while showing favourable computational cost.

Abstract: AbstractSocial science and psycholinguistic research have shown that power and status affect how people use language in a range of domains. Here, we investigate a similar question in a large, distributed, consensus-driven community with little traditional power hierarchy – the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a collaborative organisation that designs internet standards. Our analysis based on lexical categories (LIWC) and BERT, shows that participants’ levels of influence can be predicted from their email text, and identify key linguistic differences (e.g., certain LIWC categories, such as “WE” are positively correlated with high-influence). We also identify the differences in language use for the same person before and after becoming influential.

Abstract: AbstractEstimating the log-likelihood of a given sentence under an autoregressive language model is straightforward: one can simply apply the chain rule and sum the log-likelihood values for each successive token. However, for masked language models (MLMs), there is no direct way to estimate the log-likelihood of a sentence. To address this issue, Salazar et al. (2020) propose to estimate sentence pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores, computed by successively masking each sentence token, retrieving its score using the rest of the sentence as context, and summing the resulting values. Here, we demonstrate that the original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and propose an adapted metric, in which we mask not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target. We show that our adapted metric (PLL-word-l2r) outperforms both the original PLL metric and a PLL metric in which all within-word tokens are masked. In particular, it better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models. Finally, we show that the choice of metric affects even tightly controlled, minimal pair evaluation benchmarks (such as BLiMP), underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM properties.

Abstract: AbstractRecent research on dialog state tracking (DST) focuses on methods that allow few- and zero-shot transfer to new domains or schemas. However, performance gains heavily depend on aggressive data augmentation and fine-tuning of ever larger language model based architectures. In contrast, general purpose language models, trained on large amounts of diverse data, hold the promise of solving any kind of task without task-specific training. We present preliminary experimental results on the ChatGPT research preview, showing that ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot DST. Despite our findings, we argue that properties inherent to general purpose models limit their ability to replace specialized systems. We further theorize that the in-context learning capabilities of such models will likely become powerful tools to support the development of dedicated dialog state trackers and enable dynamic methods.

Abstract: AbstractMixed-initiative dialogue tasks involve repeated exchanges of information and conversational control. Conversational agents gain control by generating responses that follow particular dialogue intents or strategies, prescribed by a policy planner. The standard approach has been fine-tuning pre-trained language models to perform generation conditioned on these intents. However, these supervised generation models are limited by the cost and quality of data annotation. We instead prompt large language models as a drop-in replacement to fine-tuning on conditional generation. We formalize prompt construction for controllable mixed-initiative dialogue. Our findings show improvements over fine-tuning and ground truth responses according to human evaluation and automatic metrics for two tasks: PersuasionForGood and Emotional Support Conversations.

Abstract: AbstractExisting methods for event causality identification (ECI) focus on mining potential causal signals, i.e., causal context keywords and event pairs. However, causal signals are ambiguous, which may lead to the context-keywords bias and the event-pairs bias. To solve this issue, we propose the counterfactual reasoning that explicitly estimates the influence of context keywords and event pairs in training, so that we are able to eliminate the biases in inference.Experiments are conducted on two datasets, the result demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: AbstractTraditional text classification typically categorizes texts into pre-defined coarse-grained classes, from which the produced models cannot handle the real-world scenario where finer categories emerge periodically for accurate services. In this work, we investigate the setting where fine-grained classification is done only using the annotation of coarse-grained categories and the coarse-to-fine mapping. We propose a lightweight contrastive clustering-based bootstrapping method to iteratively refine the labels of passages. During clustering, it pulls away negative passage-prototype pairs under the guidance of the mapping from both global and local perspectives. Experiments on NYT and 20News show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Abstract: AbstractAfrica has over 2000 indigenous languages but they are under-represented in NLP research due to lack of datasets. In recent years, there have been progress in developing labelled corpora for African languages. However, they are often available in a single domain and may not generalize to other domains. In this paper, we focus on the task of sentiment classification for cross-domain adaptation. We create a new dataset, Nollywood movie reviews for five languages widely spoken in Nigeria (English, Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian Pidgin, and Yoruba). We provide an extensive empirical evaluation using classical machine learning methods and pre-trained language models. By leveraging transfer learning, we compare the performance of cross-domain adaptation from Twitter domain, and cross-lingual adaptation from English language. Our evaluation shows that transfer from English in the same target domain leads to more than 5% improvement in accuracy compared to transfer from Twitter in the same language. To further mitigate the domain difference, we leverage machine translation from English to other Nigerian languages, which leads to a further improvement of 7% over cross-lingual evaluation. While machine translation to low-resource languages are often of low quality, our analysis shows that sentiment related words are often preserved.

Abstract: AbstractState-of-the-art target-oriented opinion word extraction (TOWE) models typically use BERT-based text encoders that operate on the word level, along with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that incorporate syntactic information extracted from syntax trees. These methods achieve limited gains with GCNs and have difficulty using BERT wordpieces. Meanwhile, BERT wordpieces are known to be effective at representing rare words or words with insufficient context information. To address this issue, this work trades syntax trees for BERT wordpieces by entirely removing the GCN component from the methods’ architectures. To enhance TOWE performance, we tackle the issue of aspect representation loss during encoding. Instead of solely utilizing a sentence as the input, we use a sentence-aspect pair. Our relatively simple approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and should serve as a strong baseline for further research.

Abstract: AbstractAdvances in deep neural models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) have yielded dramatic improvements in ASR quality for resource-rich languages, with English ASR now achieving word error rates comparable to that of human transcribers. The vast majority of the world’s languages, however, lack the quantity of data necessary to approach this level of accuracy. In this paper we use four of the most popular ASR toolkits to train ASR models for eleven languages with limited ASR training resources: eleven widely spoken languages of Africa, Asia, and South America, one endangered language of Central America, and three critically endangered languages of North America. We find that no single architecture consistently outperforms any other. These differences in performance so far do not appear to be related to any particular feature of the datasets or characteristics of the languages. These findings have important implications for future research in ASR for under-resourced languages. ASR systems for languages with abundant existing media and available speakers may derive the most benefit simply by collecting large amounts of additional acoustic and textual training data. Communities using ASR to support endangered language documentation efforts, who cannot easily collect more data, might instead focus on exploring multiple architectures and hyperparameterizations to optimize performance within the constraints of their available data and resources.

Abstract: AbstractMany NLP tasks exhibit human label variation, where different annotators give different labels to the same texts. This variation is known to depend, at least in part, on the sociodemographics of annotators. Recent research aims to model individual annotator behaviour rather than predicting aggregated labels, and we would expect that sociodemographic information is useful for these models. On the other hand, the ecological fallacy states that aggregate group behaviour, such as the behaviour of the average female annotator, does not necessarily explain individual behaviour. To account for sociodemographics in models of individual annotator behaviour, we introduce group-specific layers to multi-annotator models. In a series of experiments for toxic content detection, we find that explicitly accounting for sociodemographic attributes in this way does not significantly improve model performance. This result shows that individual annotation behaviour depends on much more than just sociodemographics.

Abstract: AbstractIn statistical parsing with CCG, the standard evaluation method is based on predicate-argument structure and evaluates dependencies labelled in part by lexical categories. When a predicate has multiple argument slots that can be filled, the same lexical category is used for the label of multiple dependencies. In this paper, we show that this evaluation can result in disproportionate penalization of supertagging errors and obfuscate the truly erroneous dependencies. Enabled by the compositional nature of CCG lexical categories, we propose *decomposed scoring* based on subcategorial labels to address this. To evaluate our scoring method, we engage fellow categorial grammar researchers in two English-language judgement tasks: (1) directly ranking the outputs of the standard and experimental scoring methods; and (2) determining which of two sentences has the better parse in cases where the two scoring methods disagree on their ranks. Overall, the judges prefer decomposed scoring in each task; but there is substantial disagreement among the judges in 24% of the given cases, pointing to potential issues with parser evaluations in general.

Abstract: AbstractOne noticeable trend in metaphor detection is the embrace of linguistic theories such as the metaphor identification procedure (MIP) for model architecture design. While MIP clearly defines that the metaphoricity of a lexical unit is determined based on the contrast between its contextual meaning and its basic meaning, existing work does not strictly follow this principle, typically using the aggregated meaning to approximate the basic meaning of target words. In this paper, we propose a novel metaphor detection method, which models the basic meaning of the word based on literal annotation from the training set, and then compares this with the contextual meaning in a target sentence to identify metaphors. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method significantly by 1.0% in F1 score. Moreover, our performance even reaches the theoretical upper bound on the VUA18 benchmark for targets with basic annotations, which demonstrates the importance of modelling basic meanings for metaphor detection.

Abstract: AbstractLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 have emerged as general-purpose language models capable of addressing many natural language generation or understanding tasks. On the task of Machine Translation (MT), multiple works have investigated few-shot prompting mechanisms to elicit better translations from LLMs. However, there has been relatively little investigation on how such translations differ qualitatively from the translations generated by standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this work, we investigate these differences in terms of the literalness of translations produced by the two systems. Using literalness measures involving word alignment and monotonicity, we find that translations out of English (E-X) from GPTs tend to be less literal, while exhibiting similar or better scores on MT quality metrics. We demonstrate that this finding is borne out in human evaluations as well. We then show that these differences are especially pronounced when translating sentences that contain idiomatic expressions.

Abstract: AbstractTo transition to a green economy, environmental claims made by companies must be reliable, comparable, and verifiable. To analyze such claims at scale, automated methods are needed to detect them in the first place. However, there exist no datasets or models for this. Thus, this paper introduces the task of environmental claim detection. To accompany the task, we release an expert-annotated dataset and models trained on this dataset. We preview one potential application of such models: We detect environmental claims made in quarterly earning calls and find that the number of environmental claims has steadily increased since the Paris Agreement in 2015.

Abstract: AbstractThe increasingly widespread adoption of large language models has highlighted the need for improving their explainability. We present *context length probing*, a novel explanation technique for causal language models, based on tracking the predictions of a model as a function of the length of available context, and allowing to assign *differential importance scores* to different contexts. The technique is model-agnostic and does not rely on access to model internals beyond computing token-level probabilities. We apply context length probing to large pre-trained language models and offer some initial analyses and insights, including the potential for studying long-range dependencies. The [source code](https://github.com/cifkao/context-probing/) and an [interactive demo](https://cifkao.github.io/context-probing/) of the method are available.

Abstract: AbstractDemonstration learning aims to guide the prompt prediction by providing answered demonstrations in the few shot settings. Despite achieving promising results, existing work only concatenates the answered examples as demonstrations to the prompt template (including the raw context) without any additional operation, neglecting the prompt-demonstration dependencies. Besides, prior research found that randomly replacing the labels of demonstrations marginally hurts performance, illustrating that the model could not properly learn the knowledge brought by the demonstrations. Inspired by the human learning process, in this paper, we introduce Imitation DEMOnstration learning (Imitation-Demo) to strengthen demonstration learning via explicitly imitating human review behaviour, which includes: (1) contrastive learning mechanism to concentrate on similar demonstrations.(2) demonstration-label re-prediction method to consolidate known knowledge. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 14 classification corpus. Further studies also prove that Imitation-Demo strengthens the associations between the prompt and demonstrations, which could provide the basis for exploring how demonstration learning works.

Abstract: AbstractNeural metrics for machine translation evaluation, such as COMET, exhibit significant improvements in their correlation with human judgments, as compared to traditional metrics based on lexical overlap, such as BLEU. Yet, neural metrics are, to a great extent, “black boxes” returning a single sentence-level score without transparency about the decision-making process. In this work, we develop and compare several neural explainability methods and demonstrate their effectiveness for interpreting state-of-the-art fine-tuned neural metrics. Our study reveals that these metrics leverage token-level information that can be directly attributed to translation errors, as assessed through comparison of token-level neural saliency maps with Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) annotations and with synthetically-generated critical translation errors. To ease future research, we release our code at: https://github.com/Unbabel/COMET/tree/explainable-metrics

Abstract: AbstractDense retrieval is a basic building block of information retrieval applications. One of the main challenges of dense retrieval in real-world settings is the handling of queries containing misspelled words. A popular approach for handling misspelled queries is minimizing the representations discrepancy between misspelled queries and their pristine ones. Unlike the existing approaches, which only focus on the alignment between misspelled and pristine queries, our method also improves the contrast between each misspelled query and its surrounding queries. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare it against the existing competitors using two benchmark datasets and two base encoders. Our method outperforms the competitors in all cases with misspelled queries. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/panuthept/DST-DenseRetrieval.

Abstract: AbstractIn a controllable text generation dataset, there exist unannotated attributes that could provide irrelevant learning signals to models that use it for training and thus degrade their performance. We propose focused prefix tuning (FPT) to mitigate the problem and to enable the control to focus on the desired attribute. Experimental results show that FPT can achieve better control accuracy and text fluency than baseline models in single-attribute control tasks. In multi-attribute control tasks, FPT achieves comparable control accuracy with the state-of-the-art approach while keeping the flexibility to control new attributes without retraining existing models.

Abstract: AbstractKnowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the most effective approaches to deploying large-scale pre-trained language models in low-latency environments by transferring the knowledge contained in the large-scale models to smaller student models. Prior KD approaches use the soft labels and intermediate activations generated by the teacher to transfer knowledge to the student model parameters alone. In this paper, we show that having access to non-parametric memory in the form of a knowledge base with the teacher’s soft labels and predictions can further improve student generalization. To enable the student to retrieve from the knowledge base effectively, we propose a new framework and loss function that preserves the semantic similarities of teacher and student training examples. We show through extensive experiments that our retrieval mechanism can achieve state-of-the-art performance for task-specific knowledge distillation on the GLUE benchmark.

Abstract: AbstractRecognizing flat, overlapped and discontinuous entities uniformly has been paid increasing attention. Among these works, Seq2Seq formulation prevails for its flexibility and effectiveness. It arranges the output entities into a specific target sequence. However, it introduces bias by assigning all the probability mass to the observed sequence. To alleviate the bias, previous works either augment the data with possible sequences or resort to other formulations. In this paper, we stick to the Seq2Seq formulation and propose a reranking-based approach. It redistributes the likelihood among candidate sequences depending on their performance via a contrastive loss. Extensive experiments show that our simple yet effective method consistently boosts the baseline, and yields competitive or better results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on 8 widely-used datasets for Named Entity Recognition.

Abstract: AbstractMasked language models (MLM) do not explicitly define a distribution over language, i.e., they are not language models per se. However, recent work has implicitly treated them as such for the purposes of generation and scoring. This paper studies methods for deriving explicit joint distributions from MLMs, focusing on distributions over two tokens, which makes it possible to calculate exact distributional properties. We find that an approach based on identifying joints whose conditionals are closest to those of the MLM works well and outperforms existing Markov random field-based approaches. We further find that this derived model’s conditionals can even occasionally outperform the original MLM’s conditionals.
